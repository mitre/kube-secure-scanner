# Project Tasks Tracker

## Core Development Tasks

- [x] Implement three distroless container scanning approaches
  - [ ] Approach 1: Modify the train-k8s-container plugin (Official solution)

    - [ ] Modify connection and exec client classes
  - [x] Approach 2: CINC Auditor in debug container with chroot (Working prototype)
    - [x] Create specialized debug container with CINC Auditor pre-installed
    - [x] Implement chroot-based filesystem access to target container
    - [x] Bridge results back to host system
  - [x] Approach 3: Sidecar container with shared process namespace
    - [x] Create script for sidecar deployment and scanning
    - [x] Implement process detection and filesystem access
    - [x] Integration with CI/CD pipelines
