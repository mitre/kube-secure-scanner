## Planned Components

### Distroless Container Scanning (Dual Approach Demonstration)

- [ ] **Approach 1: Modified Train-k8s-container Plugin (Enterprise Solution)**
  - [ ] Fork and modify the train-k8s-container plugin for native distroless support
  - [ ] Add ephemeral container detection and fallback
  - [ ] Implement direct filesystem access through debug container
  - [ ] Modify connection and exec client classes
  - [ ] Create streamlined user experience with consistent commands

- [ ] **Approach 2: CINC Auditor in Debug Container (Working Prototype)**
  - [x] Create initial script with placeholder code (scan-distroless-container.sh)
  - [x] Document the approach for ephemeral container usage
  - [ ] Create specialized debug container with CINC Auditor pre-installed
  - [ ] Implement chroot-based filesystem access to target container
  - [ ] Bridge results back to host system
  - [ ] Fully document the approach's tradeoffs and use cases

- [ ] **Comparative Analysis**
  - [ ] Benchmark performance of both approaches
  - [ ] Document security implications of each approach
  - [ ] Create decision matrix for solution selection
  - [ ] Develop recommendation for enterprise environments

### Enhanced Architecture Documentation

- [ ] **System Architecture Documentation**
  - [ ] Container interaction flow diagrams
  - [ ] Security model diagrams
  - [ ] Sequence diagrams for each approach
  - [ ] Component diagrams showing interactions

- [ ] **Security Analysis Documentation**
  - [ ] Risk analysis of container scanning approaches
  - [ ] Threat modeling for both distroless approaches
  - [ ] Security controls and mitigations
  - [ ] Privilege minimization techniques

- [ ] **Decision Support Documentation**
  - [ ] Pros and cons analysis of both approaches
  - [ ] Total cost of ownership considerations
  - [ ] Maintenance and support implications
  - [ ] Formal recommendation document for stakeholders

- [ ] **Additional Guides**
  - [ ] Advanced RBAC configurations
  - [ ] Custom profile development
  - [ ] Integrating with vulnerability scanners

- [ ] **Tutorials**
  - [ ] End-to-end scanning tutorial
  - [ ] Custom profile development tutorial
  - [ ] Integrating results with security dashboards

### Testing and Validation

- [ ] **Container Type Testing**
  - [ ] Test with Google's distroless images
  - [ ] Test with custom minimalist containers
  - [ ] Test with different language runtimes (Go, Java, Python)

- [ ] **Performance Optimization**
  - [ ] Measure and optimize scan times
  - [ ] Reduce resource usage during scans
  - [ ] Optimize startup time
  - [ ] Compare performance metrics between approaches

### Extended CI/CD Examples

- [ ] **Distroless Container CI/CD Integration**
  - [ ] GitHub Actions workflow for Approach 1 (modified plugin)
  - [ ] GitHub Actions workflow for Approach 2 (chroot method)
  - [ ] GitLab CI pipeline for both approaches
  - [ ] Jenkins pipeline example
