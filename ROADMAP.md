  - [x] Implement chroot-based filesystem access to target container
  - [x] Bridge results back to host system
  - [x] Fully document the approach's tradeoffs and use cases

- [x] **Approach 3: Sidecar Container with Shared Process Namespace (Working Solution)**
  - [x] Create script for sidecar deployment and scanning
  - [x] Implement process detection and filesystem access
  - [x] Create Helm chart for sidecar container approach
  - [x] Document the sidecar approach thoroughly
