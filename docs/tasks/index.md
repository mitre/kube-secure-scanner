## Task Organization

Each task page follows a consistent format:

1. **Overview** - Brief description with security context
2. **Security Prerequisites** - Required permissions and security configurations
3. **Step-by-Step Instructions** - Clear steps with security notes
4. **Security Best Practices** - Important security recommendations
5. **Verification Steps** - How to verify successful completion
6. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions
7. **Next Steps** - Logical next tasks to perform

## Security Focus

All tasks include security considerations throughout. Look for the security admonitions:

!!! security-focus "Security Emphasis"
    These highlight key security aspects and why they matter.

!!! security-note "Security Consideration"
    These provide step-specific security guidance.
