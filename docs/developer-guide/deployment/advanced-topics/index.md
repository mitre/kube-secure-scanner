# Advanced Deployment Topics

This guide provides an overview of advanced deployment topics for the Secure CINC Auditor Kubernetes Container Scanning solution.

## Overview

Advanced deployment topics cover specialized aspects of deploying and operating the scanner solution, focusing on performance, security, monitoring, and specialized environments.

## Key Advanced Topics

We provide detailed guidance on several advanced deployment topics:

- [Scaling and Performance](scaling.md): Optimize scanner performance for large environments
- [Security Enhancements](security.md): Implement additional security measures
- [Monitoring and Maintenance](monitoring.md): Set up comprehensive monitoring and operational procedures
- [Specialized Environments](specialized-environments.md): Deploy in air-gapped and high-security environments
- [Deployment Verification](verification.md): Validate and test deployments
- [Custom Development](custom-development.md): Create custom scripts and extensions

## When to Use Advanced Topics

Consider these advanced deployment topics when:

1. **Deploying at Scale**: If you're scanning hundreds or thousands of containers
2. **High-Security Requirements**: If you're in regulated or security-sensitive environments
3. **Operational Integration**: When integrating with existing monitoring and maintenance systems
4. **Custom Requirements**: When standard deployment approaches need customization

## Getting Started with Advanced Topics

Before diving into advanced topics, ensure you:

1. Understand the [basic deployment approaches](../index.md)
2. Have a working deployment using one of the standard methods
3. Identify specific areas where advanced configuration is needed
