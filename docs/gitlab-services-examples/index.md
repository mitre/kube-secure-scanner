# GitLab Services Examples

This section provides examples for using the GitLab Services integration with Kube CINC Secure Scanner.

## Overview

GitLab Services provide a way to run additional containers alongside your CI/CD jobs. This can be particularly useful for implementing container scanning without modifying your existing pipelines.

## Examples

This directory will contain examples for GitLab Services configurations for various scanning scenarios.

!!! note
    This section is currently under development. More examples will be added in future releases.

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing GitLab Services for container scanning:

1. Use the appropriate service definition based on your scanning approach
2. Configure the necessary environment variables
3. Set up volume mounts for sharing data between the service and your job
4. Implement proper error handling
