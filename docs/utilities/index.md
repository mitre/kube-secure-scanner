# Utilities and Tools

This section contains documentation for various utilities and tools that support the Secure CINC Auditor Kubernetes Container Scanning solution.

## Overview

The utilities documentation provides information about supporting tools and utilities that enhance the development, documentation, and usage of the scanning solution. These utilities are not core to the scanning functionality but provide valuable support for developers and users working with the system.

The current focus is on documentation tools, particularly for converting legacy ASCII diagrams to Mermaid-based diagrams for better visualization and maintenance. Additional utilities may be added to this section as they are developed.

## Available Utilities

The following utilities are currently documented:

- [ASCII to Mermaid Conversion](ascii-to-mermaid.md) - Tools and guidance for converting ASCII diagrams to Mermaid diagrams

## Future Additions

We plan to add documentation for additional utilities in the future, including:

- Documentation validation scripts
- Testing utilities
- Configuration generators
- Report formatting tools

## Contributing

If you have developed a utility that would be useful for the project, please see the [Contributing Guide](../contributing/index.md) for information on how to submit it for inclusion in the project.
