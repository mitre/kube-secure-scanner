## Overview

The utilities documentation provides information about supporting tools and utilities that enhance the development, documentation, and usage of the scanning solution. These utilities are not core to the scanning functionality but provide valuable support for developers and users working with the system.

The current focus is on documentation tools, particularly for converting legacy ASCII diagrams to Mermaid-based diagrams for better visualization and maintenance. Additional utilities may be added to this section as they are developed.
