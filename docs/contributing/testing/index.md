# Documentation Testing

This section provides resources for testing documentation display features and ensuring accessibility across different viewing modes.

## Overview

Testing documentation is a critical part of ensuring a high-quality user experience. Our documentation needs to be accessible, readable, and visually consistent across different devices, browsers, and display preferences.

## Testing Areas

We focus on the following key testing areas:

1. **Accessibility Testing** - Ensuring documentation meets WCAG standards
2. **Dark/Light Mode Testing** - Verifying proper rendering in both color modes
3. **Responsive Design Testing** - Ensuring documentation looks good on all devices
4. **Interactive Elements Testing** - Testing tabs, admonitions, and code blocks

## Test Pages

The following test pages are available to help verify documentation rendering:

- [Dark/Light Mode Test](dark-light-mode-test.md) - Test page for verifying visual elements in both dark and light color schemes

## Best Practices for Documentation Testing

When testing documentation:

1. Check both light and dark modes
2. Test with screen readers and keyboard navigation
3. Verify diagrams have proper contrast ratios
4. Ensure code snippets are readable in both modes
5. Test on multiple devices and screen sizes

## Using Color Schemes That Work in Both Modes

When creating diagrams or custom elements, follow these guidelines:

- Use WCAG-compliant color combinations
- Test contrast ratios for both dark and light backgrounds
- Avoid color as the only means of conveying information
- Use patterns or shapes to supplement color coding

For specific color recommendations, see the [Diagram Color Guide](../diagram-color-guide.md).
