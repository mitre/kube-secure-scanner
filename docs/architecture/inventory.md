# Architecture & Workflows Documentation

This directory contains documentation about the workflow processes and diagrams for the Secure CINC Auditor Kubernetes Container Scanning solution.

## Contents

- [Workflow Processes](workflows.md) - End-to-end workflows for different scanning scenarios
- [Workflow Diagrams](diagrams.md) - Visual representations of system workflows using Mermaid diagrams

> **Note**: The Helm Chart Architecture documentation has been moved to the [Helm Charts](../helm-charts/architecture.md) section, as it specifically pertains to the architecture of Helm charts.

## Overview

The architecture documentation provides a comprehensive understanding of how the scanning system is designed, how the components interact, and the various workflows supported by the system. This information is valuable for both users seeking to understand how the system operates and for developers looking to extend or modify the system.

The documentation uses Mermaid diagrams extensively to visualize complex workflows and system interactions, making it easier to understand the relationships between different components.
