## Overview

The diagram documentation provides visual representations of the scanning system's architecture, making it easier to understand how components interact, how workflows execute, and how the system can be deployed in different environments.

All diagrams follow WCAG compliance standards and are rendered using Mermaid syntax, ensuring they are accessible and compatible with both GitHub and MkDocs environments.
