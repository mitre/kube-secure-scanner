# Kubernetes Setup for Secure Container Scanning

This section provides comprehensive documentation on setting up Kubernetes resources required for secure container scanning using CINC Auditor.

## Components

The Kubernetes setup for secure container scanning involves several interrelated components:

### Kubeconfig Configuration

Proper kubeconfig configuration is essential for secure API interactions with your Kubernetes cluster. This includes:

- Creating minimal-access kubeconfig files
- Configuring secure authentication methods
- Managing context and namespace isolation

See the [Kubeconfig Configuration](../configuration/README.md) guide for detailed instructions.

### RBAC Configuration

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is critical for maintaining security during container scanning operations:

- [Basic RBAC](../rbac/README.md) - Standard RBAC implementation for container scanning
- [Label-based RBAC](../rbac/label-based.md) - More targeted RBAC based on container labels

### Token Management

Secure token management ensures temporary, minimal access for scanning operations:

- Short-lived token generation
- Token scope limitations
- Token usage and renewal patterns

See the [Token Management](../tokens/README.md) guide for implementation details.

### Service Account Setup

Service accounts provide the identity for scanning operations:

- Creating dedicated service accounts
- Configuring appropriate permissions
- Linking service accounts to roles

See the [Service Accounts](../service-accounts/README.md) guide for complete instructions.

## Security Considerations

All components of the Kubernetes setup follow security best practices:

1. **Least Privilege Access**: Components are configured to use minimal required permissions
2. **Temporary Access**: Token-based authentication provides time-limited access
3. **Isolation**: Configuration ensures isolation between scanning operations
4. **Auditability**: All actions are auditable through standard Kubernetes mechanisms

For additional security guidance, see the [Security Overview](../security/overview.md) section.
