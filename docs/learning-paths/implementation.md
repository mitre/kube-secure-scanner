# Implementation Guide

## Overview

!!! security-focus "Security Emphasis"
    This learning path ensures that your implementation balances functional requirements with security considerations. By following this path, you'll deploy a secure scanner setup that follows defense-in-depth principles.

This learning path guides you through a complete implementation of Kube CINC Secure Scanner. It provides detailed steps for setting up the scanner in different environments with a focus on security, maintainability, and integration.

**Time to complete:** 2-3 hours

**Target audience:** DevOps engineers, Platform engineers, Security engineers

**Security risk:** ðŸŸ¡ Medium - Involves cluster-level installations and service account configuration

**Security approach:** Implements principle of least privilege, namespace isolation, and secure deployment patterns with proper security context configuration

## Security Architecture

???+ abstract "Understanding Permission Layers"
    A secure implementation requires managing permissions across distinct boundaries:

    **1. Cluster Administrative Permissions**
    * **Control:** Installation of core components, namespace creation, and RBAC setup
    * **Risk area:** Overly broad administrative access could compromise cluster security
    * **Mitigation:** Use dedicated service accounts with time-limited tokens for installation
    
    **2. Scanner Runtime Permissions**
    * **Control:** Scanner's ability to access and scan target containers
    * **Risk area:** Excessive permissions could allow unintended container access
    * **Mitigation:** Implement granular RBAC with namespace isolation and specific verb limitations
    
    **3. Integration Permissions**
    * **Control:** How external systems interact with the scanner infrastructure
    * **Risk area:** Integration points could expose scanner capabilities inappropriately
    * **Mitigation:** Create dedicated integration service accounts with minimal required access

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Kubernetes cluster with administrative access
- [ ] kubectl installed and configured
- [ ] Helm v3 installed (for Helm-based deployment)
- [ ] Completed the [Core Concepts](core-concepts.md) learning path or have equivalent knowledge
- [ ] Understanding of RBAC and Kubernetes security concepts

## Learning Path Steps

### Step 1: Environment Preparation {#step-1}

!!! security-note "Security Consideration"
    Plan your deployment with security boundaries in mind. Create dedicated namespaces with proper RBAC restrictions to maintain isolation.

1. Determine your deployment requirements:
   - Review the [Decision Matrix](../approaches/decision-matrix.md) to choose the best scanning approach
   - Identify required permissions and resource constraints
   - Document security requirements and boundaries

2. Create a dedicated namespace:

   ```bash
   kubectl create namespace scanner-system
   ```

3. Apply necessary RBAC configurations:

   ```bash
   # For standard approach
   kubectl apply -f kubernetes/templates/rbac.yaml -n scanner-system
   
   # For label-based RBAC (more restrictive)
   kubectl apply -f kubernetes/templates/label-rbac.yaml -n scanner-system
   ```

4. Verify RBAC permissions:

   ```bash
   # Test service account permissions
   kubectl auth can-i --as=system:serviceaccount:scanner-system:scanner list pods -n default
   ```

**Estimated time:** 30 minutes

**Success criteria:** You have a dedicated namespace with proper RBAC permissions configured.

### Step 2: Scanner Infrastructure Deployment {#step-2}

!!! security-note "Security Consideration"
    Use appropriate security context settings and resource limits to protect your cluster from potential resource exhaustion or privilege escalation.

1. Deploy the scanner infrastructure:

   **Option A: Using Helm Charts (Recommended)**

   ```bash
   # Install scanner infrastructure
   cd helm-charts
   helm install scanner-infra scanner-infrastructure/ \
     --namespace scanner-system \
     --values scanner-infrastructure/examples/values-production.yaml
   ```

   **Option B: Using Kubernetes Manifests**

   ```bash
   # Apply core manifests
   kubectl apply -f kubernetes/templates/service-account.yaml -n scanner-system
   kubectl apply -f kubernetes/templates/rbac.yaml -n scanner-system
   ```

2. Verify infrastructure deployment:

   ```bash
   kubectl get serviceaccounts -n scanner-system
   kubectl get roles,rolebindings -n scanner-system
   ```

3. Configure scanner security settings:
   - Review and apply security-hardened values from [Security Best Practices](../helm-charts/security/best-practices.md)
   - Apply network policies if needed

**Estimated time:** 30 minutes

**Success criteria:** Scanner infrastructure components are running and properly configured with security controls.

---

### Step 3: Scanner Deployment Based on Approach {#step-3}

!!! security-note "Security Consideration"
    Each scanning approach has different security implications. Ensure you understand the security tradeoffs and implement appropriate mitigations.

Choose your scanner deployment based on your selected approach:

**Option A: Standard Scanner (Kubernetes API)**

```bash
helm install standard-scanner standard-scanner/ \
  --namespace scanner-system \
  --values standard-scanner/examples/values-ci.yaml
```

**Option B: Distroless Scanner (Debug Container)**

```bash
helm install distroless-scanner distroless-scanner/ \
  --namespace scanner-system \
  --values distroless-scanner/examples/values-distroless-golang.yaml
```

**Option C: Sidecar Scanner**

```bash
helm install sidecar-scanner sidecar-scanner/ \
  --namespace scanner-system
```

Review your deployment:

```bash
helm list -n scanner-system
kubectl get all -n scanner-system
```

Configure any specific scanner options:

- Review [Configuration Reference](../helm-charts/usage/configuration.md)
- Adjust resource limits and security context settings
- Configure threshold values based on your security requirements

**Estimated time:** 30 minutes

**Success criteria:** Scanner is deployed according to your chosen approach with appropriate security configurations.

---

### Step 4: Testing Your Implementation {#step-4}

!!! security-note "Security Consideration"
    Validate that your scanner implementation maintains the security boundaries you've established and doesn't introduce new security risks.

1. Create a test pod:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f test-pod.yaml -n default
   ```

2. Run your first scan based on your chosen approach:

   **Standard Scanner**

   ```bash
   ./kubernetes-scripts/scan-container.sh default test-pod test-container examples/cinc-profiles/container-baseline examples/thresholds/strict.yml
   ```

   **Distroless Scanner**

   ```bash
   ./kubernetes-scripts/scan-distroless-container.sh default test-pod test-container examples/cinc-profiles/container-baseline examples/thresholds/strict.yml
   ```

   **Sidecar Scanner**

   ```bash
   ./kubernetes-scripts/scan-with-sidecar.sh default test-pod examples/cinc-profiles/container-baseline examples/thresholds/strict.yml
   ```

3. Review scan results:

   ```bash
   # Check the results file
   cat results/container-scan-results.json
   ```

4. Test with multiple containers and scan configurations to ensure everything works as expected.

**Estimated time:** 30 minutes

**Success criteria:** Successfully performed container scans and received valid results.

### Step 5: Integration Setup {#step-5}

!!! security-note "Security Consideration"
    When integrating with CI/CD systems, ensure credentials are properly secured and limit privileges to only what's necessary for scanning operations.

1. Configure integration with your CI/CD platform:

   **GitHub Actions**
   - Review [GitHub Actions Integration](../integration/platforms/github-actions.md)
   - Implement workflow using [GitHub Workflow Examples](../github-workflow-examples/index.md)

   **GitLab CI**
   - Review [GitLab CI Integration](../integration/platforms/gitlab-ci.md)
   - Implement pipeline using [GitLab Pipeline Examples](../gitlab-pipeline-examples/index.md)

2. Configure threshold values:
   - Review [Thresholds Integration](../integration/configuration/thresholds-integration.md)
   - Create custom threshold files for different environments

3. Configure reporting:
   - Set up results handling in your CI/CD platform
   - Implement notification mechanisms for scan failures

**Estimated time:** 30 minutes

**Success criteria:** Scanner is integrated with your CI/CD platform and produces actionable reports.
