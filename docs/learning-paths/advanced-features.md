## Learning Path Steps

### Step 1: Advanced RBAC Configuration {#step-1}

!!! security-note "Security Consideration"
    Fine-grained RBAC is critical for maintaining the principle of least privilege and preventing unauthorized access to sensitive resources.

1. Implement label-based RBAC for targeted scanning:
   - Review [Label-Based RBAC](../rbac/label-based.md)
   - Create namespace labels for controlling scan access:

   ```bash
   kubectl label namespace default scan-allowed=true
   ```

2. Apply enhanced RBAC configuration:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f kubernetes/templates/label-rbac.yaml
   ```

3. Configure time-bound tokens:
   - Review [Token Management](../tokens/index.md)
   - Implement token expiration controls

4. Verify RBAC restrictions:

   ```bash
   # Test access to labeled namespaces
   kubectl auth can-i --as=system:serviceaccount:scanner-system:scanner list pods -n default
   
   # Test access to unlabeled namespaces (should fail)
   kubectl auth can-i --as=system:serviceaccount:scanner-system:scanner list pods -n kube-system
   ```

**Estimated time:** 30 minutes

**Success criteria:** Scanner has restricted access to only labeled namespaces with appropriate time-bound tokens.

### Step 2: Enhanced Security Controls {#step-2}

!!! security-note "Security Consideration"
    Implementing defense-in-depth requires multiple layers of security controls that work together to provide comprehensive protection.

1. Implement network policies:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: NetworkPolicy
   metadata:
     name: scanner-network-policy
     namespace: scanner-system
   spec:
     podSelector:
       matchLabels:
         app: scanner
     policyTypes:
     - Ingress
     - Egress
     ingress:
     - from:
       - namespaceSelector:
           matchLabels:
             scan-allowed: "true"
     egress:
     - to:
       - namespaceSelector:
           matchLabels:
             scan-allowed: "true"
     - to:
       - podSelector:
           matchLabels:
             app: scanner-results
   ```

2. Apply security context enhancements:
   - Review [Security Hardening](../configuration/security/hardening.md)
   - Update Helm values for enhanced pod security:

   ```bash
   helm upgrade standard-scanner standard-scanner/ \
     --namespace scanner-system \
     --set securityContext.readOnlyRootFilesystem=true \
     --set securityContext.runAsNonRoot=true \
     --set securityContext.runAsUser=10001 \
     --set securityContext.allowPrivilegeEscalation=false
   ```

3. Implement resource quotas and limits:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: ResourceQuota
   metadata:
     name: scanner-quota
     namespace: scanner-system
   spec:
     hard:
       requests.cpu: "2"
       requests.memory: 4Gi
       limits.cpu: "4"
       limits.memory: 8Gi
   EOF
   ```

**Estimated time:** 30 minutes

**Success criteria:** Enhanced security controls applied to scanner components with verified restrictions.

### Step 3: Advanced Thresholds and Reporting {#step-3}

!!! security-note "Security Consideration"
    Advanced threshold configurations allow for more granular control over security requirements, helping to balance operational needs with security requirements.

1. Implement advanced threshold configurations:
   - Review [Advanced Thresholds](../configuration/thresholds/advanced.md)
   - Create environment-specific threshold files:

   ```yaml
   # strict-production.yml
   compliance:
     total_pass: 95.0
     critical_controls_pass: 100.0
   scoring:
     critical:
       points: 100
       maximum_allowed_fail: 0
     high:
       points: 40
       maximum_allowed_fail: 0
     medium:
       points: 15
       maximum_allowed_fail: 2
     low:
       points: 5
       maximum_allowed_fail: 5
   ```

2. Configure custom reporting formats:
   - Review [Reporting Configuration](../integration/configuration/reporting.md)
   - Set up JSON, XML, and HTML report formats

3. Implement compliance mapping:
   - Map controls to compliance frameworks
   - Create compliance-specific threshold files

4. Test advanced threshold configurations:

   ```bash
   ./kubernetes-scripts/scan-container.sh default test-pod test-container examples/cinc-profiles/container-baseline examples/strict-production.yml
   ```

**Estimated time:** 30 minutes

**Success criteria:** Advanced threshold configurations implemented with custom reporting formats.

### Step 4: Enterprise Integration {#step-4}

!!! security-note "Security Consideration"
    When integrating with enterprise systems, ensure proper authentication, secure communication channels, and appropriate access controls.

1. Integrate with security information and event management (SIEM):
   - Configure report forwarding to SIEM systems
   - Set up alerts for critical findings

2. Implement automated remediation workflows:
   - Create ticket integration for findings
   - Set up notification systems
   - Configure escalation paths

3. Integrate with compliance dashboards:
   - Configure report aggregation
   - Map findings to compliance controls

4. Set up multi-environment scanning:
   - Configure scanning for development, staging, and production
   - Implement different threshold levels per environment

**Estimated time:** 45 minutes

**Success criteria:** Scanner integrated with enterprise security and compliance systems.

### Step 5: Custom Profile Development {#step-5}

!!! security-note "Security Consideration"
    Custom security profiles allow you to address organization-specific security requirements and enhance your security posture beyond baseline standards.

1. Create a custom security profile:

   ```ruby
   # custom-controls/controls/01_custom_checks.rb
   control 'CUSTOM-001' do
     impact 1.0
     title 'Custom Security Control'
     desc 'This control verifies organization-specific security requirements'
     
     describe file('/etc/custom-security-config') do
       it { should exist }
       its('content') { should match /security_level=high/ }
     end
   end
   ```

2. Add custom control to your profile:

   ```yaml
   # custom-profile/inspec.yml
   name: custom-container-profile
   title: Custom Container Security Profile
   version: 1.0.0
   depends:
     - name: container-baseline
       path: ../container-baseline
   ```

3. Test your custom profile:

   ```bash
   ./kubernetes-scripts/scan-container.sh default test-pod test-container examples/custom-profile examples/thresholds/strict.yml
   ```

4. Implement profile versioning and distribution process:
   - Set up profile versioning
   - Create profile distribution mechanism
   - Document profile customization process

**Estimated time:** 45 minutes

**Success criteria:** Custom security profile created, tested, and implemented in your scanning workflow.
