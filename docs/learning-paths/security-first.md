# Security-First Implementation

## Overview

!!! security-focus "Security Emphasis"
    This learning path prioritizes security at every step, ensuring your implementation adheres to security best practices, follows the principle of least privilege, and incorporates defense-in-depth strategies.

This learning path guides you through implementing Kube CINC Secure Scanner with security as the primary focus. By following this path, you will create a highly secure implementation that balances security requirements with operational needs.

**Time to complete:** 90-120 minutes

**Target audience:** Security professionals, DevSecOps engineers, Compliance officers

**Security risk:** ðŸŸ¢ Low - Focuses on security-enhancing implementation patterns

**Security approach:** Implements defense-in-depth strategy with layered security controls, least-privilege access management, and secure-by-design principles

## Security Architecture

???+ abstract "Understanding Permission Layers"
    A security-first implementation requires careful management of multiple permission layers:

    **1. Cluster Administrator Permissions**
    * **Control:** Installation of core components and management of cluster-wide resources
    * **Risk area:** Over-provisioned admin accounts could compromise the entire cluster
    * **Mitigation:** Use dedicated service accounts for administration with time-limited credentials
    
    **2. Namespace-Level Security Controls**
    * **Control:** Isolation between different scanning operations and target resources
    * **Risk area:** Cross-namespace access could lead to privilege escalation
    * **Mitigation:** Implement strict namespace boundaries with proper RBAC and network policies
    
    **3. Container Scanner Permissions**
    * **Control:** Scanner's ability to access and evaluate container content
    * **Risk area:** Scanner credentials could be exposed if not properly managed
    * **Mitigation:** Generate ephemeral, single-use credentials scoped to specific containers

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Basic understanding of Kubernetes security concepts
- [ ] Familiarity with RBAC and Kubernetes security controls
- [ ] Completed the [New User Guide](new-users.md) or equivalent experience
- [ ] Administrative access to a Kubernetes cluster

## Learning Path Steps

### Step 1: Security Principles Assessment {#step-1}

!!! security-note "Security Consideration"
    Understanding the security principles before implementation ensures your design decisions align with security best practices.

1. Review the security principles documentation:
   - [Security Principles Overview](../security/principles/index.md)
   - [Least Privilege Principle](../security/principles/least-privilege.md)
   - [Ephemeral Credentials](../security/principles/ephemeral-creds.md)
   - [Resource Isolation](../security/principles/resource-isolation.md)
   - [Secure Transport](../security/principles/secure-transport.md)

2. Complete the security assessment checklist:
   - [ ] Identify sensitive data flows in your environment
   - [ ] Document security boundaries and trust zones
   - [ ] Define minimum required permissions for scanner operation
   - [ ] Determine isolation requirements for your environment

**Estimated time:** 20 minutes

**Success criteria:** Completed security assessment checklist with documented security requirements.

### Step 2: Secure Configuration Planning {#step-2}

!!! security-note "Security Consideration"
    Properly configured RBAC is critical for maintaining the principle of least privilege and preventing unauthorized access.

1. Design your RBAC configuration:
   - Review [RBAC Configuration](../rbac/index.md) and [Label-Based RBAC](../rbac/label-based.md)
   - Create roles with minimum necessary permissions
   - Consider using namespace isolation

2. Plan service account configuration:
   - Review [Service Accounts](../service-accounts/index.md)
   - Document service account requirements
   - Consider time-limited tokens

3. Review kubeconfig security:
   - [Kubeconfig Security](../configuration/kubeconfig/security.md)
   - [Dynamic Kubeconfig Generation](../configuration/kubeconfig/dynamic.md)

**Estimated time:** 25 minutes

**Success criteria:** Documented RBAC plan, service account strategy, and kubeconfig security controls.

---

### Step 3: Secure Deployment {#step-3}

!!! security-note "Security Consideration"
    Implement defense-in-depth by applying security controls at each layer of your deployment.

1. Create dedicated namespaces for scanner components:

   ```bash
   kubectl create namespace scanner-system
   ```

2. Apply RBAC configurations:

   ```bash
   # Apply your custom RBAC configuration or use the provided template
   kubectl apply -f kubernetes/templates/rbac.yaml
   ```

3. Deploy using Helm with security-focused values:
   - Review [Helm Security Best Practices](../helm-charts/security/best-practices.md)
   - Deploy scanner infrastructure with security hardening:

   ```bash
   cd helm-charts
   helm install scanner-infra scanner-infrastructure/ --values scanner-infrastructure/examples/values-production.yaml
   ```

4. Verify security controls:

   ```bash
   # Verify RBAC
   kubectl auth can-i --as=system:serviceaccount:scanner-system:scanner list pods
   ```

**Estimated time:** 30 minutes

**Success criteria:** Scanner deployed with RBAC, namespace isolation, and security hardening measures.

---

### Step 4: Security Testing and Validation {#step-4}

!!! security-note "Security Consideration"
    Validate security controls to ensure they're effective and identify any gaps that need to be addressed.

1. Perform security testing:
   - Test RBAC boundaries
   - Verify namespace isolation
   - Attempt to access scanner from unauthorized contexts

2. Run security scan with thresholds:

   ```bash
   ./kubernetes-scripts/scan-container.sh scanner-system scanner-pod scanner-container examples/cinc-profiles/container-baseline examples/thresholds/strict.yml
   ```

3. Review scan results and security indicators.

4. Document security posture and any identified gaps.

**Estimated time:** 25 minutes

**Success criteria:** Validated security controls and documented security posture.

## Security Considerations

This section provides a comprehensive overview of security considerations:

- **Network Security**:
    - Use network policies to restrict communication between components
    - Implement TLS for all communications
    - Consider using service mesh for additional security controls

- **Credential Management**:
    - Use short-lived credentials whenever possible
    - Rotate service account tokens regularly
    - Store sensitive configuration in Kubernetes Secrets

- **Monitoring and Auditing**:
    - Enable audit logging for scanner activities
    - Monitor for unauthorized access attempts
    - Implement alerting for security-relevant events

- **Compliance Controls**:
    - Document how implementation meets compliance requirements
    - Maintain evidence of security controls for audits
    - Establish regular security review process

## Compliance Relevance

This learning path helps address the following compliance requirements:

- **Kubernetes STIG** - Implements controls aligned with DISA Kubernetes STIG requirements
- **CIS Benchmarks** - Follows CIS Kubernetes Benchmark recommendations
- **NIST 800-53** - Addresses Access Control (AC), Audit and Accountability (AU), and System and Information Integrity (SI) controls
- **DoD 8500.01** - Supports implementation of security controls required by DoD directives
