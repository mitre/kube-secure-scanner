# Security Documentation Reorganization Plan

## Current Structure Analysis

The current security section contains several large, comprehensive files:

1. **index.md**: Overview of security aspects and principles
2. **overview.md**: Security design principles and threat mitigation
3. **analysis.md**: Detailed security analysis of the different approaches
4. **risk-analysis.md**: Comprehensive risk assessment for each approach
5. **compliance.md**: Detailed compliance analysis against security frameworks

The content is well-organized but includes large, complex documents that cover multiple aspects of security. This makes it challenging for users to find specific information about individual security topics.

## Proposed Directory Structure

I propose reorganizing the security section as follows:

```
/docs/security/
├── index.md                  # Overview and introduction to security documentation
├── inventory.md              # Directory listing of all security documentation

└── recommendations/          # Security recommendations subdirectory
    ├── index.md              # Overview of security recommendations
    ├── enterprise.md         # Enterprise security recommendations
    ├── ci-cd.md              # CI/CD security recommendations
    ├── monitoring.md         # Security monitoring recommendations
    ├── network.md            # Network security recommendations
    └── inventory.md          # Directory listing
```

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Create Directory Structure**: Set up all the subdirectories
2. **Create Index Files**: Create overview index.md for each subdirectory
3. **Create Inventory Files**: Create inventory.md for each subdirectory
4. **Extract Content**: Move content from existing files to new focused files
5. **Update Main Index**: Convert main index.md to serve as a unified entry point
6. **Update Navigation**: Update mkdocs.yml with new navigation structure

## Navigation Structure in mkdocs.yml

```yaml
- Security:
  - Overview: security/index.md
  - Directory Contents: security/inventory.md

## Expected Benefits

1. **Improved Readability**: Smaller, focused files will be easier to read and understand
2. **Better Navigation**: Logical hierarchy makes information easier to find
3. **Focused Topics**: Users can quickly find specific security information
4. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Users only need to focus on relevant security aspects
5. **Easier Maintenance**: Smaller files are easier to update and maintain
6. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All security aspects properly documented in dedicated files

## Implementation Timeline

1. Create directory structure and base files
2. Implement principles section
3. Implement risk section
4. Implement compliance section
5. Implement threat model section
6. Implement recommendations section
7. Update main index.md and inventory.md
8. Update navigation in mkdocs.yml
9. Review and validate all cross-references
10. Test navigation and readability

## Next Steps

1. Get approval for this restructuring plan
2. Begin implementation with directory creation
3. Start extracting and reorganizing content
4. Update navigation and cross-references
