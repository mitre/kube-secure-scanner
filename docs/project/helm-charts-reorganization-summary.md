# Helm Charts Documentation Reorganization Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the reorganization of the Helm Charts documentation section, which was completed on March 25, 2025. The reorganization follows the content organization pattern established in our [Content Organization Approach](content-organization-approach.md) document.

## Reorganization Structure

The Helm Charts documentation has been reorganized from a flat structure into a logical hierarchy of subdirectories, each with focused content files. The new structure is as follows:

```
docs/helm-charts/
├── index.md                # Main overview with redirects
├── inventory.md            # Directory listing 
├── overview/               # Overview subdirectory
│   ├── index.md            # High-level overview
│   ├── inventory.md        # Directory listing
│   └── architecture.md     # Architecture diagrams and explanations
├── scanner-types/          # Scanner types subdirectory
│   ├── index.md            # Introduction to scanner types
│   ├── inventory.md        # Directory listing
│   ├── common-scanner.md   # Common scanner documentation
│   ├── standard-scanner.md # Standard scanner (Kubernetes API)
│   ├── distroless-scanner.md # Distroless scanner (Debug Container)
│   └── sidecar-scanner.md  # Sidecar scanner documentation
├── infrastructure/         # Infrastructure subdirectory
│   ├── index.md            # Infrastructure overview
│   ├── inventory.md        # Directory listing
│   ├── rbac.md             # RBAC configurations
│   ├── service-accounts.md # Service account setup
│   └── namespaces.md       # Namespace configuration
├── usage/                  # Usage and customization subdirectory
│   ├── index.md            # Usage overview
│   ├── inventory.md        # Directory listing
│   ├── customization.md    # Customization guide
│   ├── configuration.md    # Configuration reference
│   └── values.md           # Values file documentation
├── security/               # Security subdirectory
│   ├── index.md            # Security overview
│   ├── inventory.md        # Directory listing
│   ├── best-practices.md   # Security best practices
│   ├── rbac-hardening.md   # RBAC hardening guide
│   └── risk-assessment.md  # Risk assessment by chart
└── operations/             # Operations subdirectory
    ├── index.md            # Operations overview
    ├── inventory.md        # Directory listing
    ├── troubleshooting.md  # Troubleshooting guide
    ├── performance.md      # Performance optimization
    └── maintenance.md      # Maintenance procedures
```

## Content Transformation

The content from the original files was extracted and distributed into focused files within the new structure. Key transformations include:

1. **overview.md** → Split into overview/index.md and overview/architecture.md
2. **architecture.md** → Moved to overview/architecture.md with component details extracted to scanner-types/* files
3. **scanner-infrastructure.md** → Split across infrastructure/* files
4. **common-scanner.md**, **standard-scanner.md**, **distroless-scanner.md**, **sidecar-scanner.md** → Moved to scanner-types/* with additional content extracted to usage/configuration.md
5. **customization.md** → Moved to usage/customization.md with configuration details extracted to usage/configuration.md
6. **security.md** → Split across security/* files
7. **troubleshooting.md** → Moved to operations/troubleshooting.md with additional performance and maintenance content extracted to operations/performance.md and operations/maintenance.md

## Navigation Updates

The navigation in mkdocs.yml was updated to reflect the new structure, with logical grouping of related topics:

```yaml

```

## Benefits of Reorganization

The Helm Charts documentation reorganization provides several benefits:

1. **Improved Readability**: Smaller, focused files are easier to read and understand
2. **Enhanced Navigation**: Logical hierarchy makes information easier to find
3. **Topic Separation**: Clear separation of concerns between different aspects of Helm chart documentation
4. **Consistent Structure**: Follows the same pattern as other reorganized sections
5. **Maintainability**: Smaller files are easier to update and maintain
6. **Comprehensive Coverage**: New structure ensures all aspects of Helm charts are documented

## Next Steps

With the completion of the Helm Charts reorganization, we can now focus on:

1. Reorganizing the Configuration section
2. Reorganizing the Architecture section
3. Reorganizing the Integration section
4. Continuing the Phase 4 (review and refinement) of documentation refactoring
