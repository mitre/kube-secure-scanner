# Integration Section Reorganization Summary

This document summarizes the reorganization of the integration section in the Kube CINC Secure Scanner documentation.

## Reorganization Overview

The integration section has been reorganized to provide a more structured and focused approach to documentation. The reorganization follows the established pattern used for other sections, breaking down large documentation files into focused files organized in a logical directory structure.

## Directory Structure

The reorganized integration section now has the following structure:

1. `/docs/integration/` (Main directory)
   - index.md (Overview and navigation guide)
   - inventory.md (Complete listing of all files)
   - approach-mapping.md (Mapping of scanning approaches to CI/CD platforms)
   - overview.md (General overview of integration capabilities)
   - gitlab-services-analysis.md (Analysis of GitLab Services integration approach)

2. `/docs/integration/platforms/` (CI/CD Platforms)
   - index.md (Overview of platform integrations)
   - inventory.md (Listing of platform files)
   - github-actions.md (GitHub Actions integration)
   - gitlab-ci.md (GitLab CI integration)
   - gitlab-services.md (GitLab Services integration)
   - jenkins.md (Jenkins integration)
   - azure-devops.md (Azure DevOps integration)
   - custom-platforms.md (Custom CI/CD platform integration)

3. `/docs/integration/workflows/` (Integration Workflows)
   - index.md (Overview of integration workflows)
   - inventory.md (Listing of workflow files)
   - standard-container.md (Standard container workflow integration)
   - distroless-container.md (Distroless container workflow integration)
   - sidecar-container.md (Sidecar container workflow integration)
   - security-workflows.md (Security-focused integration workflows)

4. `/docs/integration/examples/` (Practical Examples)
   - index.md (Overview of integration examples)
   - inventory.md (Listing of example files)
   - github-examples.md (GitHub Actions examples)
   - gitlab-examples.md (GitLab CI examples)
   - gitlab-services-examples.md (GitLab Services examples)
   - custom-examples.md (Custom integration examples)

5. `/docs/integration/configuration/` (Integration Configuration)
   - index.md (Overview of integration configuration)
   - inventory.md (Listing of configuration files)
   - environment-variables.md (Environment variable configuration)
   - secrets-management.md (Secrets and token management)
   - thresholds-integration.md (Integration with threshold configuration)
   - reporting.md (Results reporting configuration)

## Content Organization

The content has been organized according to the following principles:

1. **Platform-Specific Content**: Documentation specific to CI/CD platforms is placed in the platforms/ directory.
2. **Workflow-Specific Content**: Documentation focused on integration workflows is placed in the workflows/ directory.
3. **Example Content**: Practical implementation examples are placed in the examples/ directory.
4. **Configuration Content**: Integration configuration guidance is placed in the configuration/ directory.

## Implementation Details

The reorganization was implemented using the following steps:

1. **Directory Structure Creation**: Created the necessary subdirectories for the reorganized content.
2. **Index Files Creation**: Created comprehensive index.md and inventory.md files for each subdirectory.
3. **Content Migration**: Moved and adapted content from existing files to the new structure:
   - Moved github-actions.md to platforms/github-actions.md
   - Moved gitlab.md to platforms/gitlab-ci.md
   - Moved gitlab-services.md to platforms/gitlab-services.md
   - Created other placeholder files for future content
4. **Cross-References Update**: Updated cross-references between files to reflect the new structure.
5. **Main Navigation Update**: Updated the main integration/index.md and integration/inventory.md files to reflect the new structure.

## Content Improvements

During the reorganization, the following content improvements were made:

1. **Enhanced Navigation**: Improved navigation structure with logical grouping of related topics.
2. **Clear Entry Points**: Created clear entry points for different types of integration information.
3. **Focused Content**: Broke down large topics into focused files for improved readability.
4. **Cross-References**: Added comprehensive cross-references between related topics.
5. **Consistent Structure**: Applied a consistent structure across all subdirectories.

## Next Steps

The following steps are recommended to further enhance the integration section:

1. **Content Extraction**: Extract focused content from existing files to populate the workflow, example, and configuration files.
2. **Content Enhancement**: Enhance the content with diagrams, examples, and best practices.
3. **Cross-References Validation**: Validate cross-references between files to ensure proper navigation.
4. **Content Review**: Conduct a comprehensive review of the content for accuracy and consistency.
5. **User Journey Testing**: Test typical user journeys through the documentation to ensure a smooth experience.
