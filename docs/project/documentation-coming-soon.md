## Implementation Notes

When implementing these documents:

1. **Follow the established structure**: Use the same structure as existing documents in the respective sections
2. **Update inventory files**: Update relevant inventory.md files when adding new documents
3. **Update navigation**: Ensure new documents are added to the MkDocs navigation in mkdocs.yml
4. **Fix cross-references**: Update any links pointing to the "coming soon" placeholders
5. **Follow the process documentation**: Use the scripts described in `docs/project/warning-resolution-scripts.md` to validate and fix any new issues

## Priority Order (Suggested)

1. Approaches section documents - these are core functionality documents
2. Integration platforms - these are important for CI/CD integrations
3. Examples - these are useful reference materials but less critical

The above priority order is a suggestion based on the likely user journey through the documentation, focusing on core concepts first, then integration, and finally examples.
