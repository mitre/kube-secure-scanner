# Content Organization Approach

This document outlines the approach for organizing documentation content for optimal readability and navigation.

## Overview

In addition to our basic directory structure pattern with index.md and inventory.md files, we've identified the need to break down large documentation pages into smaller, more focused subsections. This approach improves readability, makes navigation more intuitive, and allows users to find specific information more quickly.

## Content Organization Pattern

For comprehensive documentation sections, we follow this organization pattern:

1. **Section Overview Page**
   - A high-level introduction to the topic area
   - Summary of key concepts and subtopics
   - Links to detailed subtopic pages
   - Serves as the entry point for the section

2. **Dedicated Subdirectory**
   - Create a subdirectory named after the section
   - Place all subtopic files in this directory
   - Include index.md and inventory.md in the subdirectory

3. **Individual Topic Pages**
   - Create separate markdown files for each subtopic
   - Focus each file on a specific aspect of the larger topic
   - Keep files focused and concise (typically under 300 lines)
   - Use consistent naming conventions (e.g., `scaling.md`, `security.md`)

4. **Redirect Pattern**
   - Keep the original section file as a redirect page
   - Include a note about reorganization
   - Provide links to all subtopic pages
   - Ensures backward compatibility with existing links

## Navigation Structure

In the MkDocs navigation:

```yaml
# Example navigation structure
- Section Name:
  - Overview: section/index.md
  - Directory Contents: section/inventory.md
  - Subtopic Group A:
    - First Subtopic: section/subtopic1.md
    - Second Subtopic: section/subtopic2.md
  - Subtopic Group B:
    - Third Subtopic: section/subtopic3.md
    - Fourth Subtopic: section/subtopic4.md
```

## Implementation Examples

We have successfully applied this pattern to the following sections:

1. **Deployment Scenarios**
   - Created scenarios subdirectory
   - Broke down into individual scenario files (enterprise.md, development.md, etc.)
   - Added comprehensive index.md and inventory.md files
   - Updated navigation with logical grouping

2. **Advanced Deployment Topics**
   - Created advanced-topics subdirectory
   - Split into focused topic files (scaling.md, security.md, etc.)
   - Created detailed cross-references between related topics
   - Maintained the original file as a redirect

3. **Scanning Approaches**
   - Created dedicated subdirectories for each approach:
     - kubernetes-api/ - For the Kubernetes API approach
     - debug-container/ - For the Debug Container approach
     - sidecar-container/ - For the Sidecar Container approach
     - helper-scripts/ - For the Helper Scripts documentation
   - Implemented focused topic files for each aspect (implementation, limitations, security, etc.)
   - Created comprehensive index.md and inventory.md files for each approach
   - Updated navigation with logical grouping by approach
   - Improved cross-references between related approaches

## When to Apply This Approach

Consider breaking down content into subtopics when:

1. The content exceeds 300 lines in a single file
2. The section covers multiple distinct concepts or approaches
3. Users would likely be interested in specific subsections rather than the entire content
4. The content would benefit from a hierarchical organization
5. Different user personas would be interested in different subsections

## Implementation Process

To implement this approach for a section:

1. **Analyze Content**
   - Review existing content and identify logical divisions
   - Plan the subdirectory and file structure
   - Identify connections between subtopics

2. **Create Directory Structure**
   - Create a subdirectory named after the section
   - Plan file names that reflect their content

3. **Create Content Files**
   - Start with index.md for the section overview
   - Create individual files for each subtopic
   - Ensure each file is focused and comprehensive
   - Add cross-references between related subtopics

4. **Update Original File**
   - Convert the original file to a redirect page
   - Include a note about reorganization
   - List links to all new subtopic pages

5. **Update Navigation**
   - Update mkdocs.yml to reflect the new structure
   - Group related subtopics under appropriate headings
   - Ensure logical navigation flow

6. **Test and Validate**
   - Verify all pages are accessible
   - Check for proper rendering
   - Test navigation flow and usability

## Sections to Apply This Pattern

Based on our analysis, the following sections should be considered for this reorganization approach:

| Section | Current Status | Priority | Notes |
|---------|----------------|----------|-------|
| Approaches | âœ… Completed | High | Split scanning approaches into individual directories with focused files |
| Security | âœ… Completed | High | Created dedicated subdirectories for principles, risk, compliance, threat-model, and recommendations |
| Helm Charts | âœ… Completed | High | Reorganized into overview/, scanner-types/, infrastructure/, usage/, security/, and operations/ subdirectories |
| Configuration | ðŸ“… Planned | Medium | Separate by configuration target |
| Architecture | ðŸ“… Planned | Medium | Split by architectural component |
| Integration | ðŸ“… Planned | Medium | Separate by integration platform |

## Expected Benefits

Implementing this organization pattern will:

1. **Improve Readability**: Smaller, focused files are easier to read and understand
2. **Enhance Navigation**: Logical hierarchy makes information easier to find
3. **Facilitate Maintenance**: Smaller files are easier to update and maintain
4. **Support Collaboration**: Multiple contributors can work on different subtopics
5. **Reduce Cognitive Load**: Users only need to focus on relevant subtopics
