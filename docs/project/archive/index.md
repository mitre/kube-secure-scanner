# Archived Documentation

This section contains documentation that has been archived but is maintained for historical reference.

## Overview

As the Kube CINC Secure Scanner project evolves, some documentation becomes outdated or is replaced by newer content. Rather than deleting this content, we maintain it in the archive for reference purposes.

## Archived Content

The archive currently contains:

- [ASCII Diagrams](ascii-diagrams.md) - Original ASCII diagram documentation that has been replaced by Mermaid diagrams

## Usage Notes

Archived content is maintained for:

- Historical reference
- Understanding the evolution of the project
- Providing context for older references or discussions

Please note that archived content may not reflect the current state of the project, and newer documentation should be consulted for up-to-date information.
