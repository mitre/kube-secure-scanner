## Next Actions

1. Continue combined UI enhancement and cross-referencing across all files:
   - Complete enhancement of learning paths (security-first.md, core-concepts.md, advanced-features.md)
   - Complete enhancement of task pages (starting with remaining container scan tasks)
   - Follow established patterns from new-users.md and standard-container-scan.md
   - Ensure bidirectional links between all related content
2. Implement breadcrumb navigation and additional navigation aids
3. Add content discovery enhancements (tags, "You might also be interested in" sections)
4. Prepare for Phase 5 testing and refinement

## Documentation Structure

The current structure follows a multi-layered approach:

1. **User Personas and Entry Points**
   - Getting Started section with security content elevated
   - Learning Paths section for guided implementation

2. **Task-Oriented Documentation**
   - Common Tasks section for frequently performed operations
   - Deployment Scenarios section for specific environments

3. **Technical Reference Documentation**
   - Technical Documentation section with comprehensive references
   - Reference section with consolidated configuration details

4. **Project Information**
   - Project section with project management and meta-documentation
