      - Contributing: contributing/index.md
      - Roadmap: project/roadmap.md
      - Changelog: project/changelog.md
      - Documentation Tools: utilities/index.md

    # Complete index for discoverability
    - Documentation Index:
      - Full Site Index: site-index.md  # New page with links to all content
      - Documentation Structure: project/documentation-structure-progress.md

  Key Features of this Hybrid Approach:

  1. Multiple Entry Points: Users can access content through tasks, roles, or technical structure depending on their needs
  2. Progressive Detail: Simple tasks are easily accessible at the top level, while detailed technical documentation is organized systematically in deeper levels
  3. Role-based Guides: New section to help users based on their specific role in the organization
  4. Task-oriented Section: Front-loads the most common tasks to help users get started quickly
  5. Deployment Scenarios: Brings special deployment cases to the top level for visibility
  6. Consolidated References: All reference documentation is organized in one place
  7. Complete Documentation Index: Ensures all content remains discoverable

  Implementation Strategy:

  1. Create new landing pages for each of the task-based and role-based sections
  2. Generate a comprehensive site index that includes links to all content
  3. Implement this navigation structure while preserving all existing content
  4. Add cross-linking between related content to help users navigate
  5. Add "Related Resources" sections at the bottom of new pages to point to the detailed documentation

  This hybrid approach offers:

- Quick access to common tasks
- Role-specific guidance
- Structured technical documentation
- Clear deployment scenarios
- Comprehensive references
- Complete discoverability of all content

  It combines the best elements of task-based, role-based, and layered approaches while ensuring no content becomes inaccessible.
