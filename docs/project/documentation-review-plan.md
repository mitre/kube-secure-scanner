# Documentation Review Plan (Phase 4)

This document outlines the systematic approach for implementing Phase 4 (Review and Refinement) of our documentation entry point refactoring plan.

## Review Findings Summary

Based on our comprehensive analysis, we've identified several key areas requiring attention:

1. **Critical Content Mismatch**
   - kubernetes-api.md actually contains content about distroless container scanning
   - debug-container.md appears to focus only on debugging, not scanning

2. **Terminology Inconsistencies**
   - Terms like "Kubernetes API Approach" vs "Standard Container Scanning"
   - Inconsistent descriptions of approaches across documents
   - Use of aliases marked "to avoid" in terminology.md
   - Non-standardized parenthetical descriptions

3. **Content Redundancy**
   - Duplicated approach descriptions across multiple documents
   - Implementation details appearing in executive-summary.md
   - Business value statements in technical documents
   - Workflow descriptions repeated in multiple locations

4. **User Journey Gaps**
   - Missing direct links between related documents in user journeys
   - kubernetes-api.md content mismatch disrupts DevOps Engineer journey
   - Lack of clear prerequisites specific to each approach
   - Missing troubleshooting guidance for each approach

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Critical Content Fixes (Priority 1)

1. **Fix kubernetes-api.md content mismatch:**
   - Create properly named file for distroless content
   - Create new kubernetes-api.md with correct content about the Kubernetes API approach
   - Update all links to ensure proper references

2. **Fix debug-container.md content focus:**
   - Expand debug-container.md to include scanning aspects, not just debugging
   - Ensure consistent application of terminology
   - Add proper links to relevant documentation

### 2. Terminology Standardization (Priority 2)

1. **Replace non-standard terms with official terminology:**
   - Search and replace "Standard Container Scanning" with "Kubernetes API Approach"
   - Remove all parenthetical descriptions not part of official terms
   - Update all approach descriptions to match standardized descriptions in terminology.md

2. **Audit key files for consistent terminology:**
   - index.md
   - overview/README.md
   - executive-summary.md
   - quickstart.md
   - approaches/* files

### 3. Content Redundancy Elimination (Priority 3)

1. **Refactor duplicated approach descriptions:**
   - Move all approach technical details to approaches/* files
   - Keep only brief overview in index.md
   - Ensure executive-summary.md focuses solely on business value
   - Update quickstart.md to link to approaches/* files instead of duplicating

2. **Remove implementation details from non-implementation documents:**
   - Remove technical implementation steps from executive-summary.md
   - Move business value statements from overview/README.md to executive-summary.md
   - Consolidate workflow descriptions in architecture/workflows.md

### 4. User Journey Enhancement (Priority 4)

1. **Fix DevOps Engineer journey:**
   - Ensure kubernetes-api.md contains correct content
   - Add clear links between implementation steps
   - Improve approach selection guidance

2. **Enhance cross-document linking:**
   - Add "Next Steps" sections at the end of each key document
   - Implement "Related Topics" sections
   - Create clearer path between architecture/diagrams.md and approaches/decision-matrix.md

3. **Add journey-specific enhancements:**
   - Create approach-specific prerequisites in quickstart.md
   - Add troubleshooting matrix for each approach
   - Ensure key questions from content-map.md are answered in each document

## Validation Testing

After implementing changes, we will validate improvements through:

1. **Automated Link Testing:**
   - Run `./docs-tools.sh links` to verify all internal links
   - Check cross-references between related documents

2. **Terminology Consistency Test:**
   - Search for known aliases to verify they've been eliminated
   - Validate all approach descriptions match standardized language

3. **User Journey Walk-throughs:**
   - Test each user journey by following all links in sequence
   - Verify all critical information is accessible along each path
   - Check that each journey presents a coherent narrative

4. **MkDocs Navigation Verification:**
   - Build the site with `./docs-tools.sh build`
   - Test navigation structure and breadcrumbs
   - Verify no 404 errors or navigation dead-ends

## Action Items

1. **Critical Fixes:**
   - âœ… Normalized README.md vs index.md usage across documentation
   - âœ… Created index.md files for key sections (overview, approaches, architecture, security, etc.)
   - âœ… Updated mkdocs.yml navigation to use index.md files consistently
   - âœ… Created proper kubernetes-api.md content with correct Kubernetes API approach information
   - âœ… Moved distroless content to debug-container.md where it belongs
   - âœ… Expanded debug-container.md with proper scanning aspects
   - âœ… Created kubernetes-setup/index.md for documentation consistency
   - ðŸ”„ Update all links to reflect reorganized content (partially complete)
     - âœ… Fixed links in quickstart/index.md
     - âœ… Fixed links in security/overview.md
     - âœ… Fixed links in kubernetes-setup directory
     - ðŸ”„ Still working on remaining links in other files

2. **Terminology Updates:**
   - [ ] Update index.md with standardized terminology
   - [ ] Update overview/index.md with consistent descriptions
   - [ ] Fix executive-summary.md terminology
   - [ ] Update quickstart.md methods with proper naming
   - [ ] Review all approaches/* files for consistent terminology

3. **Content Refinement:**
   - [ ] Remove duplicated approach descriptions
   - [ ] Move implementation details to appropriate locations
   - [ ] Consolidate workflows in architecture/workflows.md
   - [ ] Move business value content to executive-summary.md

4. **User Journey Enhancement:**
   - [ ] Add "Next Steps" sections to key documents
   - [ ] Implement "Related Topics" sections
   - [ ] Create approach-specific prerequisites
   - [ ] Add troubleshooting matrix for each approach

## Timeline

1. **March 24, 2025:** Complete critical content fixes
2. **March 25, 2025:** Implement terminology standardization
3. **March 26, 2025:** Address content redundancy
4. **March 27, 2025:** Enhance user journeys
5. **March 28, 2025:** Conduct final validation and make additional refinements

## Success Criteria

The Phase 4 implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All critical content mismatches are resolved
2. Terminology is consistent across all documents
3. Redundancy is eliminated with content in appropriate locations
4. User journeys flow smoothly without gaps or obstacles
5. All validation tests pass without errors
6. The documentation effectively serves the needs of all target audiences
