# Documentation Clean-up Progress Tracking

This document tracks the progress of fixing cross-references and link issues throughout the documentation.

## Processing Steps

For each section, we follow these comprehensive steps:

1. **Documentation Issue Detection**: Run `extract-doc-warnings.sh --info` to identify all issue types
2. **Basic Link Fixing**: Run `fix-links-simple.sh` to update file moves with comprehensive mappings
3. **Relative Path Fixing**: Fix relative paths and convert absolute paths to relative
4. **INFO Message Handling**: Fix directory links, add missing anchors, and analyze "-new" files
5. **Verification**: Check results with MkDocs build to confirm fixed links
6. **Special Cases**: Address any section-specific issues that require manual attention

## MkDocs Build Warnings Tracking

Initial warning count: ~125 link warnings

| Date | Warnings Count | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| March 26, 2025 | 125 | Starting point |
| March 26, 2025 | 44 | After fixing integration/platforms and integration/examples |
| March 26, 2025 | 23 | After fixing approaches section links |
| March 26, 2025 | 16 | After fixing helper-scripts documentation |
| March 26, 2025 | 7 | After fixing security section links |
| March 26, 2025 | 0 | After fixing remaining links and addressing INFO messages |
| March 26, 2025 | 0 | Verified all sections: configuration, helm-charts, rbac, service-accounts, tokens, kubernetes-setup, and overview |

The documentation is now 100% compliant with no warnings. We've also addressed INFO messages by:

1. Converting directory links to index.md references
2. Converting absolute links to relative paths
3. Adding missing anchor points in target files
4. Removing redundant "-new" files after comparison

## Project Cleanup Report

We've created a comprehensive cleanup-script.sh for managing project maintenance:

| File Type | Count | Action |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Backup files (*.bak,*.backup, etc.) | 2 | Identified for removal |
| Test files (test-*.md, test-*.sh, etc.) | 11 | Identified for removal |
| Warning tracking files (*warning*.txt) | 8 | Identified for removal |
| Unused documentation files | 37 | Identified for review |

The script identifies files into several categories:

1. **Backup files**: Safe to remove after verification
2. **Test files**: Created during testing, safe to remove if no longer needed
3. **Warning tracking files**: Can be removed after warnings are fixed
4. **Unused documentation files**: Require manual review to determine appropriate action

### Cleanup Procedure

1. Review the cleanup report in the `cleanup-report/` directory
2. For backup, test, and warning files:
   - Run `./cleanup-script.sh --remove` to clean up
3. For unused documentation files:
   - Manually review each file in `cleanup-report/unused-files.txt`
   - Determine if each file should be:
     a) Added to mkdocs.yml navigation
     b) Kept as reference but not in navigation
     c) Removed as no longer needed
4. Create a documentation review checklist for unused files

## Final Verification

We have completed verification for all processed sections:

1. ✅ MkDocs build - 0 warnings achieved
2. ✅ INFO message handling - Directory links, absolute paths fixed
3. ✅ Cross-reference verification - All links now resolve correctly
4. ✅ Navigation checks - Key documentation paths work correctly
5. ✅ Project maintenance - Created comprehensive cleanup-script.sh with:
   - Cross-platform compatibility (Linux and macOS)
   - Intelligent file categorization
   - Safe operation with dry-run mode
   - Detailed reporting capabilities

For remaining sections, follow the enhanced process:

1. Run `./scripts/extract-doc-warnings.sh --info` to identify issues
2. Fix warnings and errors first (critical for build)
3. Address INFO messages for optimal documentation
4. Compare any "-new" files with originals
5. Verify with `cd docs && ./docs-tools.sh build`
6. Update documentation-cleanup-progress.md after each section
