## Approach Alignment with NSA/CISA Guide

The three scanning approaches have different levels of alignment with NSA/CISA hardening recommendations:

### Kubernetes API Approach

- **Strong Alignment (90%)**: Most closely follows NSA/CISA guidance
- **Key Strengths**:
  - Maintains strict pod isolation
  - Uses standard Kubernetes APIs (no non-standard features)
  - Requires minimal, well-defined permissions
  - Creates clear audit trail
  - No pod modification required
  - Excellent network boundary preservation
- **Key Weaknesses**:
  - Limited distroless container support (planned enhancement)
- **Configuration Example**:
  ```yaml
  # train-k8s-container transport configuration
  transport:
    name: train-k8s-container
    connection_timeout: 15 # seconds
    pod_name: target-pod
    container_name: target-container
    namespace: target-namespace
  ```
- **NSA/CISA Advantages**: Follows least privilege principle, maintains namespace boundaries, uses standard interfaces

### Debug Container Approach

- **Moderate Alignment (70%)**: Mixed compliance with NSA/CISA guidance
- **Key Strengths**:
  - Works with distroless containers (NSA recommended)
  - Provides temporary access only
  - Ephemeral containers reduce attack surface
  - Maintains namespace isolation
- **Key Concerns**:
  - Uses debug features (NSA recommends standard interfaces)
  - Requires additional privileges beyond minimum necessary
  - Limited auditing capabilities for debug container operations
  - More complex RBAC configuration
- **Configuration Example**:
  ```yaml
  # Debug container configuration for distroless targets
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: debug-container
    annotations:
      debug.container/target: distroless-pod
  spec:
    ephemeralContainers:
    - name: cinc-scanner
      image: registry/cinc-scanner:latest
      securityContext:
        runAsNonRoot: true
        capabilities:
          drop: ["ALL"]
  ```
- **NSA/CISA Analysis**: While this approach supports distroless containers (a recommended practice), it uses debug features which may introduce security risks that require additional controls and documentation.

### Sidecar Container Approach

- **Limited Alignment (50%)**: Most significant deviations from NSA/CISA guidance
- **Key Strengths**:
  - Works with distroless containers
  - Compatible with all Kubernetes versions
  - Supports non-root execution
- **Key Concerns**:
  - **Explicitly violates** NSA/CISA recommendation against process namespace sharing
  - Breaks pod isolation boundaries
  - Requires significantly more privileges
  - Complicates audit trails and monitoring
  - Requires pod definition changes
  - Weakens container isolation model
- **Configuration Example**:
  ```yaml
  # Sidecar container configuration
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: pod-with-sidecar
  spec:
    shareProcessNamespace: true # Required for this approach - VIOLATES NSA/CISA GUIDANCE
    containers:
    - name: app-container
      image: app-image
    - name: cinc-scanner
      image: registry/cinc-scanner:latest
      securityContext:
        runAsNonRoot: true
        readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
  ```
- **NSA/CISA Analysis**: The NSA/CISA guide specifically recommends maintaining strong isolation boundaries between containers. This approach's reliance on process namespace sharing fundamentally contradicts this guidance and would require formal risk acceptance and documentation in compliant environments.

## Approach Selection Considerations

The NSA/CISA guidance presents an interesting compliance tradeoff for our scanning approaches:

!!! info "Balancing Distroless Support with Other Security Controls"
    The NSA/CISA guidance specifically recommends using container-specific operating systems like distroless containers, which have minimal attack surfaces. This is one area where our Debug Container and Sidecar approaches currently have an advantage over the Kubernetes API approach.
    
    The Kubernetes API approach (using train-k8s-container transport) works well with standard containers but has limited support for distroless containers right now. That's why it's marked with ‚ö†Ô∏è and "(Planned)" - indicating this is a planned enhancement.
    
    This creates an interesting compliance tradeoff:
    
    1. The Kubernetes API approach has better overall security posture and alignment with most NSA/CISA controls (namespace isolation, minimal privileges, clear audit trail)
    2. The Debug Container and Sidecar approaches have better alignment with the specific NSA/CISA recommendation for supporting distroless containers
    
    This highlights why having multiple approaches is valuable - they have different strengths. For environments using distroless containers, using the Debug Container approach might be justified despite other shortcomings, specifically because it addresses this important NSA/CISA recommendation.
    
    When we complete the planned enhancement to the train-k8s-container plugin to support distroless containers, the Kubernetes API approach will become the clear leader across all categories, achieving near 100% alignment with NSA/CISA guidance.

Organizations should evaluate their specific requirements and container technologies when selecting a scanning approach, considering both the NSA/CISA alignment and their specific operational needs.

## Gap Analysis and Remediation

Areas where our implementation needs improvement to fully align with NSA/CISA guidance:

1. **Complete Vulnerability Scanning Integration**
   - **Gap**: Limited to CINC Auditor compliance scanning
   - **Remediation**: Planned integration with Anchore Grype for CVE detection
   - **NSA/CISA Requirement**: "Scan container images for vulnerabilities regularly"

2. **Comprehensive Audit Logging**
   - **Gap**: Scanner-focused logging without broader cluster context
   - **Remediation**: Enhanced integration with Kubernetes audit logs
   - **NSA/CISA Requirement**: "Enable auditing for sensitive actions"

3. **Pod Security Admission Enforcement**
   - **Gap**: Scanning without enforcement
   - **Remediation**: Planned integration with Pod Security Admission webhook
   - **NSA/CISA Requirement**: "Implement Pod Security Standards"

4. **Process Namespace Isolation (Sidecar Approach)**
   - **Gap**: Sidecar approach requires process namespace sharing
   - **Remediation**: Document risk and provide risk acceptance templates for environments that must use this approach
   - **NSA/CISA Requirement**: "Maintain isolation between containers"
   - **Documentation**: Environments using the Sidecar approach in NSA/CISA-compliant environments should document the risk acceptance and justification

5. **Advanced RBAC Implementation**
   - **Gap**: Debug Container and Sidecar approaches require broader permissions
   - **Remediation**: Enhanced RBAC templates with more restrictive controls
   - **NSA/CISA Requirement**: "Use RBAC with least privilege"

6. **Distroless Container Support in Kubernetes API Approach**
   - **Gap**: Limited support for distroless containers in the Kubernetes API approach
   - **Remediation**: Complete the planned enhancement to the train-k8s-container plugin for native distroless support
   - **NSA/CISA Requirement**: "Use container-specific OS"
   - **Impact**: Once completed, the Kubernetes API approach would achieve near 100% alignment with NSA/CISA recommendations, becoming fully compliant while maintaining its superior security properties compared to other approaches
