# Security Documentation

This document provides an overview of the security aspects of the Secure CINC Auditor Kubernetes Container Scanning platform.

    For a complete listing of all files in this section, see the [Security Documentation Inventory](inventory.md).

## Security Principles

The platform is built on several core security principles:

1. **Least Privilege Access**: Using minimal permissions needed for container scanning
2. **Temporary Credentials**: Employing short-lived tokens (default 15-minute lifespan)
3. **Namespace Isolation**: Restricting access to specific namespaces
4. **Dynamic Access Control**: Creating temporary, targeted access for scanning
5. **No Privileged Access**: Avoiding privileged containers or elevated permissions

## Key Security Features

| Feature | Description | Benefit |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Temporary Tokens** | Service account tokens with 15-minute default lifespan | Reduces risk of credential compromise |
| **Targeted RBAC** | Role-based access control scoped to specific pods | Minimizes potential attack surface |
| **Label-based Restrictions** | RBAC rules that can target pods by labels | Provides flexible, precise access control |
| **Time-limited Access** | Credentials valid only for the duration of a scan | Prevents persistence of unnecessary access |
| **Non-privileged Scanning** | Scanning without requiring privileged containers | Maintains container security boundaries |

## Security Approach by Scanning Method

Each scanning approach implements security controls appropriate for its method:

### Kubernetes API Approach

- Uses least-privilege RBAC with temporary service account tokens
- Requires access only to specific pods in target namespaces
- Creates time-limited credentials for each scan
- Most secure approach from a compliance perspective

### Debug Container Approach

- Creates temporary debug containers for scanning
- Requires ephemeral container permissions
- Removes debug containers after scanning
- Implements appropriate RBAC controls for ephemeral container creation

### Sidecar Container Approach

- Uses pod-level isolation with shared process namespace
- Requires no cluster-wide permissions
- Scans directly from within the pod
- Implements appropriate container security contexts
