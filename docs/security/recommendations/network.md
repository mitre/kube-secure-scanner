# Network Security Recommendations

This document provides network security recommendations for deploying and operating the Secure CINC Auditor Kubernetes Container Scanning solution.

## Overview

Network security is a critical aspect of container scanning, ensuring that communications remain secure and that scan results and credentials are protected during transit.

## Network Security Controls

### Transport Layer Security

- **TLS Encryption**: All communications between components should use TLS 1.2 or higher
- **Certificate Validation**: Properly validate certificates for all components
- **Certificate Rotation**: Implement regular certificate rotation procedures

### Network Policies

- **Restrict Pod Communication**: Implement Kubernetes Network Policies to limit pod-to-pod communication
- **Egress Filtering**: Control outbound connections from scanning components
- **Ingress Protection**: Limit inbound connections to only required endpoints

## Scanning Approach Considerations

### Kubernetes API Approach

- Configure proper TLS for all API communications
- Implement Network Policies to restrict scanner pods
- Use internal Kubernetes DNS for service discovery

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: scanner-network-policy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: scanner
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: scanner-namespace
  egress:
  - to:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: scan-target-namespace
```

### Debug Container Approach

- Ensure debug containers have limited network access
- Apply Network Policies to restrict debug container communications
- Limit egress to required services only

### Sidecar Container Approach

- Configure proper TLS for sidecar communications
- Implement pod-level network restrictions
- Isolate scanner network traffic from application traffic

## Air-Gapped Environments

For air-gapped or high-security environments:

1. Pre-package all required container images
2. Implement proper image transfer procedures
3. Configure scanning without external dependencies
4. Use internal artifact repositories for profiles and dependencies

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Default Deny Network Policies**: Start with default deny policies and add specific allowances
2. **Separate Control Plane Traffic**: Isolate scanner control communications from data traffic
3. **Encrypt All Communications**: Ensure all network traffic is encrypted, even within the cluster
4. **Monitor Network Traffic**: Implement network monitoring to detect unusual patterns
