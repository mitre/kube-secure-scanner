# Security Risk Analysis

This document provides a comprehensive security analysis of the three container scanning approaches provided by this project. Each approach has different security characteristics, risks, and mitigations that are important to understand when selecting the appropriate method for your environment.

## Security Risk Overview

| Security Factor | Standard Scanning | Debug Container | Sidecar Container |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Required Privileges** | Container access | Ephemeral container creation | Process namespace sharing |
| **Attack Surface** | Minimal | Moderate | Moderate |
| **Credential Exposure** | Minimal | Minimal | Minimal |
| **Isolation Level** | High | Moderate | Lower |
| **Persistence Risk** | None (stateless) | None (ephemeral) | Container lifetime |

## Detailed Risk Assessment

### 1. Standard Container Scanning (train-k8s-container)

**Security Model**: Uses Kubernetes API to execute commands within target containers.

#### Risks:
- Requires shell access within container
- Transport plugin requires minimal RBAC permissions
- Standard kubeconfig authentication process

#### Mitigations:
- Uses time-limited service account tokens
- Strict RBAC permissions limit access to specific containers
- No additional infrastructure components
- Scan process executes and exits quickly

#### Security Verdict: **Lowest Risk**
This approach has the simplest security model with fewest points of failure. Limited to containers with shell access.

### 2. Debug Container Approach

**Security Model**: Creates an ephemeral debug container attached to target pod's namespace.

#### Risks:
- Requires permissions to create ephemeral containers
- Debug container has access to target container filesystem
- Ephemeral container must contain scanning tools

#### Mitigations:
- Debug container is ephemeral (deleted after scan)
- Time-limited tokens for authentication
- RBAC limits which pods/containers can be targeted
- Filesystem access is read-only

#### Security Verdict: **Moderate Risk**
More complex security model but ephemeral nature limits persistence risks. Requires API server capability for ephemeral containers.

### 3. Sidecar Container Approach

**Security Model**: Uses shared process namespace between containers in the same pod.

#### Risks:
- Process namespace sharing allows visibility into target processes
- Scanner container persists during pod lifetime
- Direct filesystem access via /proc/<pid>/root
- Potential container escape techniques could be misused

#### Mitigations:
- Strict RBAC permissions for sidecar deployment
- Non-privileged container runs in user namespace
- No host filesystem access required
- Read-only access to process filesystem

#### Security Verdict: **Moderate-Higher Risk**
Most complex security model with more potential attack vectors. Shared process namespace is a powerful capability that should be carefully controlled.

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Universal Mitigations (All Approaches)

1. **Least-Privilege RBAC**
   - Limit service accounts to minimum required permissions
   - Use namespace-scoped roles, not cluster roles
   - Apply label selector constraints when possible

2. **Short-lived Credentials**
   - Generate tokens with 15-minute (or less) expiration
   - Revoke tokens after scan completion
   - Use token request API instead of long-lived secrets

3. **Scan Isolation**
   - Run scans from isolated environments
   - Limit network access during scanning
   - Use resource quotas to prevent DoS conditions

4. **Security Context**
   - Run scanner containers as non-root users
   - Apply seccomp and AppArmor profiles when possible
   - Use read-only root filesystem for scanner containers

### Approach-Specific Mitigations

#### Standard Scanning
- Validate container integrity before scanning
- Limit scan duration with timeout controls
- Run scanner with minimal network access

#### Debug Container
- Use dedicated, minimal scanner image
- Apply strict resource limits
- Automatically terminate debug containers after scan
- Monitor for unauthorized debug container creation

#### Sidecar Container
- Implement process namespace security policies
- Use dedicated service accounts for sidecar deployment
- Consider short-lived pods dedicated to scanning
- Monitor for unauthorized sidecar injection

## Enterprise Security Recommendations

1. **Scanning Governance**
   - Implement approval processes for scanning operations
   - Log all scanning activities with detailed attribution
   - Setup alerts for unauthorized scanning attempts

2. **CI/CD Pipeline Controls**
   - Ensure pipeline credentials are properly secured
   - Validate scanner configuration before deployment
   - Scan the scanner images themselves for vulnerabilities

3. **Network Controls**
   - Implement network policies to restrict scanner communication
   - Consider running scanning operations in dedicated namespaces
   - Implement egress filtering for scanning components

4. **Monitoring and Auditing**
   - Monitor for abnormal scanning patterns
   - Audit scanner configuration changes
   - Review scanner logs for suspicious activities

5. **Image Security**
   - Ensure scanner images are from trusted sources
   - Regularly update scanner components
   - Sign scanner images with trusted signatures

## Comparison and Selection

| Consideration | Best Approach |
|---------------|---------------|
| **Maximum Security** | Standard Scanning |
| **Universal Coverage** | Sidecar Container |
| **Feature Compatibility** | Debug Container |
| **Minimal Permissions** | Standard Scanning |
| **CI/CD Integration** | All approaches equal |

**Selection Framework**:
1. If all containers have shell access → Use Standard Scanning
2. If using Kubernetes 1.16+ with ephemeral containers → Consider Debug Container approach
3. If need universal solution or restricted environments → Use Sidecar Container approach

For critical or highly sensitive environments, consider implementing additional security controls regardless of chosen approach.

## Conclusion

All three scanning approaches can be implemented securely with proper controls. The standard scanning approach provides the simplest security model with lowest risk, while the debug and sidecar approaches introduce additional capabilities at the cost of slightly increased security complexity. Organizations should select the approach that best balances their security requirements with their operational needs.
