| **Credential Lifespan** | 🟢 Short-lived tokens | 🟢 Short-lived tokens | 🟢 Short-lived tokens |
| **Resource Boundaries** | 🟢 Strong | 🟠 Moderate | 🟠 Moderate |
| **"One Process Per Container"** | 🟢 Respected | 🟠 Temporarily violated | 🔴 Permanently violated |

## Industry Standards Alignment

The Secure Kubernetes Container Scanning solution has been designed with alignment to key industry security standards and best practices:

### NIST SP 800-190 Application Container Security Guide

| NIST Control Area | Implementation |
|-------------------|----------------|
| **Container Images** | Regular scanning for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations |
| **Container Runtime** | Least-privilege execution with minimal capabilities |
| **Orchestrator Security** | Strong RBAC controls and namespace isolation |
| **Container Deployment** | Secure deployment patterns without privileged access |

All scanning approaches implement NIST SP 800-190 recommended controls, with the Kubernetes API Approach offering the highest level of alignment.

### NSA/CISA Kubernetes Hardening Guidelines

Our scanning approaches implement key recommendations from the NSA/CISA Kubernetes Hardening Guidelines:

1. **Pod Security Standards**: All approaches enforce pod security controls
2. **Network Separation**: Proper network policies for scanner components
3. **Authentication and Authorization**: Strong RBAC implementation with least privilege
4. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all scanning activities
5. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Integrated compliance validation

The Kubernetes API Approach best aligns with these guidelines by minimizing deviations from Kubernetes security best practices.

### CIS Benchmarks

Our solution aligns with both CIS Kubernetes and Docker Benchmarks:

| CIS Benchmark Area | Implementation |
|--------------------|----------------|
| **RBAC Configuration** | Specific, limited roles for scanning operations |
| **Container Privileges** | Non-privileged container execution |
| **Resource Limits** | Defined CPU and memory constraints |
| **Network Policies** | Restricted network access for scanners |

### MITRE ATT&CK for Containers

The scanning approaches help mitigate several container-related attack techniques from the MITRE ATT&CK framework:

| ATT&CK Technique | Mitigation |
|------------------|------------|
| **T1610 - Deploy Container** | Strong RBAC prevents unauthorized container deployment |
| **T1613 - Container Discovery** | Limited visibility to container resources |
| **T1543.005 - Container Service** | Prevents modification of container configurations |
| **T1552 - Unsecured Credentials** | Short-lived tokens prevent credential theft |

## Docker Best Practices Alignment

Our approach alignment with Docker's best practices:

### Decouple Applications (One Process Per Container)

- **Kubernetes API Approach**: 🟢 Fully maintains the "one process per container" principle
- **Debug Container Approach**: 🟠 Temporarily introduces a second container but removes it after scanning
- **Sidecar Container Approach**: 🔴 Permanently introduces an additional container for scanning

### Minimize Container Privileges

All approaches implement the principle of least privilege, with:
- Non-root users for scanning operations
- Minimal capabilities granted to containers
- Read-only filesystem where possible
- No privileged containers used

### Secure Container Supply Chain

Our scanning solution integrates with secure container supply chain practices:
- Supports scanning of signed images
- Verifies image integrity before scanning
- Integrates with CI/CD pipeline vulnerability scanning
- Provides evidence for container compliance attestation

## Threat Model Analysis

### Key Threats Addressed

1. **Unauthorized Access to Container Contents**
   - All approaches use strong RBAC controls
   - Limited access duration through short-lived tokens
   - Namespace isolation for multi-tenant environments

2. **Privilege Escalation**
   - Non-privileged scanning operations
   - Minimal container capabilities
   - No host filesystem mounts

3. **Information Disclosure**
   - Scanning results properly secured
   - Network policies restrict communication
   - Logs sanitized of sensitive information

4. **Denial of Service**
   - Resource limits on all scanner components
   - Graceful handling of failed scans
   - Timeouts for long-running operations

### Approach-Specific Security Considerations

#### Kubernetes API Approach
- **Strengths**: Minimal attack surface, maintains container isolation
- **Considerations**: Depends on Kubernetes API server availability

!!! success "Recommended Approach"
    The Kubernetes API Approach is the enterprise-recommended solution as it provides the strongest security posture with minimal attack surface and adherence to container design principles.

#### Debug Container Approach
- **Strengths**: Temporary access, automatically removed after scanning
- **Considerations**: Temporarily breaks container isolation, requires ephemeral container feature

!!! warning "Interim Solution"
    While functional, the Debug Container Approach temporarily breaks container isolation and should be considered an interim solution until the Kubernetes API Approach is fully implemented for distroless containers.

#### Sidecar Container Approach
- **Strengths**: Works with all Kubernetes versions, universal container support
- **Considerations**: Permanently adds components to pods, increases resource usage

!!! caution "Alternative Approach"
    The Sidecar Container Approach violates the "one process per container" principle and permanently increases the attack surface. Use only when other approaches are not viable, and implement additional security controls to mitigate risks.

## Compliance Validation Controls

The solution implements controls for compliance validation:

1. **Evidence Collection**
   - All scanning approaches collect and preserve evidence of compliance
   - Results formatted for integration with security dashboards
   - Detailed logs for audit trail

2. **Attestation Support**
   - SAF-CLI integration for generating attestation reports
   - Threshold-based pass/fail determination
   - Integration with Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

3. **Automated Remediation**
   - Findings can trigger automated remediation workflows
   - Integration with CI/CD pipelines for feedback
   - Policy-as-code implementation for consistent enforcement

## Security Best Practices Implementation

| Best Practice | Implementation |
|---------------|----------------|
| **Defense in Depth** | Multiple security controls at different layers |
| **Least Privilege** | Minimal permissions for scanning operations |
| **Secure Defaults** | Conservative default settings for all components |
| **Fail Secure** | Scanning operations fail closed rather than open |
| **Secure Logging** | Comprehensive, non-sensitive logging |
| **Regular Updates** | Scanner components updated with security patches |

## Conclusion

!!! info "Strategic Direction"
    Our strategic priority is to implement and use the Kubernetes API Approach for all container scanning, including distroless containers. The other approaches are provided as interim solutions.

The Kubernetes API Approach provides the strongest security posture among the three scanning approaches, with the highest alignment to industry standards and best practices. It maintains container security boundaries, minimizes attack surface, and preserves the integrity of containerized applications.

For distroless containers, the Debug Container and Sidecar Container approaches offer viable interim solutions with acceptable security tradeoffs until distroless support is implemented in the Kubernetes API Approach. All approaches implement strong security controls and align with enterprise security requirements.

!!! tip "Enterprise Recommendation"
    For enterprise environments with stringent security requirements, invest in implementing the Kubernetes API Approach for all container types. The approach modification required for distroless containers provides a better long-term solution than maintaining multiple scanning methodologies.

The comprehensive security analysis demonstrates that all approaches provide strong security controls while meeting container scanning needs. The Kubernetes API Approach is recommended as the target universal solution for long-term deployment, offering the best balance of security, performance, and operational simplicity.
