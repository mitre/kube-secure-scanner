# Security Threat Model

This document provides an overview of the threat model for the Secure CINC Auditor Kubernetes Container Scanning platform.

## Introduction

A comprehensive threat model is essential for understanding potential security risks and implementing effective mitigations. This section outlines the threat modeling approach, identified threats, and mitigation strategies.

## Threat Modeling Approach

Our threat modeling approach follows the STRIDE methodology to identify potential threats:

- **S**poofing - Impersonating users or services
- **T**ampering - Modifying data or code
- **R**epudiation - Denying actions
- **I**nformation disclosure - Exposing sensitive information
- **D**enial of service - Disrupting services
- **E**levation of privilege - Gaining unauthorized access

## Key Threats and Mitigations

### Identified Threats

1. [Unauthorized Access to Container Contents](attack-vectors.md#unauthorized-access)
2. [Privilege Escalation](attack-vectors.md#privilege-escalation)
3. [Information Disclosure](attack-vectors.md#information-disclosure)
4. [Denial of Service](attack-vectors.md#denial-of-service)
5. [Lateral Movement](lateral-movement.md)
6. [Token Exposure](token-exposure.md)

### Mitigation Strategies

Our comprehensive [Threat Mitigations](threat-mitigations.md) include:

- Strong RBAC controls
- Minimal container capabilities
- Limited access duration through short-lived tokens
- Namespace isolation for multi-tenant environments
- Resource limits on all scanner components
- Network policies to restrict communication

## Approach-Specific Threat Analysis

Each scanning approach has unique threat characteristics:

| Threat Category | Kubernetes API Approach | Debug Container Approach | Sidecar Container Approach |
|-----------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Attack Surface** | 🟢 Minimal | 🟠 Temporarily increased | 🟠 Moderately increased |
| **Container Isolation** | 🟢 Fully preserved | 🟠 Temporarily broken | 🟠 Partially broken |
| **Token Exposure Risk** | 🟢 Low | 🟢 Low | 🟢 Low |
| **Lateral Movement Risk** | 🟢 Low | 🟠 Medium | 🟠 Medium |

## Defense-in-Depth Strategy

Our security approach implements defense-in-depth with multiple security layers:

1. **Authentication Layer**
   - Time-limited tokens
   - Service account isolation

2. **Authorization Layer**
   - Fine-grained RBAC
   - Minimal permission scope

3. **Isolation Layer**
   - Namespace boundaries
   - Container isolation

4. **Monitoring Layer**
   - Comprehensive logging
   - Access monitoring
