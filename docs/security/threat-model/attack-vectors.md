# Attack Vectors Analysis

This document analyzes potential attack vectors against the Secure CINC Auditor Kubernetes Container Scanning solution, with a focus on their likelihood, impact, and implemented mitigations.

## <a id="unauthorized-access"></a>Unauthorized Access to Container Contents

### Description

This attack vector involves unauthorized users gaining access to container contents, potentially exposing sensitive data, configurations, or intellectual property.

### Attack Paths

1. **Compromised Service Account**: Attacker obtains a service account token with container access permissions
2. **RBAC Misconfiguration**: Overly permissive RBAC roles grant unnecessary access
3. **Authentication Bypass**: Exploitation of authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access
4. **Token Theft**: Interception or exfiltration of valid access tokens

### Mitigations

| Mitigation | Implementation | Effectiveness |
|------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Least Privilege RBAC** | Service accounts with minimal permissions | High |
| **Time-limited Tokens** | Tokens expire after 15-30 minutes | High |
| **Namespace Isolation** | RBAC roles limited to specific namespaces | Medium-High |
| **Resource Name Constraints** | Access limited to specific pods | High |
| **Audit Logging** | Comprehensive logging of all access attempts | Medium |

### Approach-Specific Considerations

| Scanning Approach | Attack Vector Exposure | Additional Mitigations |
|-------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Kubernetes API** | Low | Standard API access controls |
| **Debug Container** | Medium | Ephemeral container lifecycle management |
| **Sidecar Container** | Medium-High | Process namespace restrictions, security contexts |

## <a id="privilege-escalation"></a>Privilege Escalation

### Description

This attack vector involves attackers gaining higher privileges than intended, potentially allowing them to modify resources, access sensitive data, or compromise the cluster.

### Attack Paths

1. **Container Escape**: Breaking out of container boundaries to access host or other containers
2. **Permission Escalation**: Leveraging permissions to gain additional access
3. **Capability Abuse**: Exploiting container capabilities to perform privileged operations
4. **Vulnerable Components**: Exploiting vulnerabilities in scanner or Kubernetes components

### Mitigations

| Mitigation | Implementation | Effectiveness |
|------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Non-privileged Execution** | Scanner runs as non-root user | High |
| **Minimal Capabilities** | Containers run with minimal Linux capabilities | High |
| **Read-only Filesystem** | Scanner uses read-only root filesystem | Medium-High |
| **Security Contexts** | Strict security contexts for all containers | High |
| **No Host Mounts** | Containers have no access to host filesystem | High |

### Approach-Specific Considerations

| Scanning Approach | Attack Vector Exposure | Additional Mitigations |
|-------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Kubernetes API** | Low | Standard container boundaries maintained |
| **Debug Container** | Medium | Limited debug container capabilities |
| **Sidecar Container** | Medium-High | Process isolation controls, additional security contexts |

## <a id="information-disclosure"></a>Information Disclosure

### Description

This attack vector involves unauthorized access to sensitive information, such as container contents, scanning results, or security findings.

### Attack Paths

1. **Result Interception**: Capturing scan results during transmission
2. **Log Analysis**: Extracting sensitive information from logs
3. **Token Extraction**: Obtaining service account tokens from exposed locations
4. **Scanning Process Analysis**: Analyzing scanner behavior to infer container contents

### Mitigations

| Mitigation | Implementation | Effectiveness |
|------------|----------------|---------------|
| **TLS Communication** | All API communication encrypted | High |
| **Secure Result Handling** | Proper encryption and access controls for results | Medium-High |
| **Minimal Logging** | Limited sensitive data in logs | Medium |
| **Token Security** | Secure handling of service account tokens | High |
| **Network Policies** | Restricted communication between components | Medium-High |

### Approach-Specific Considerations

| Scanning Approach | Attack Vector Exposure | Additional Mitigations |
|-------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Kubernetes API** | Low | Standard API security controls |
| **Debug Container** | Medium | Ephemeral container network isolation |
| **Sidecar Container** | Medium | Pod-level network policies |

## <a id="denial-of-service"></a>Denial of Service

### Description

This attack vector involves disrupting scanning operations or targeting container workloads through resource exhaustion or service interruption.

### Attack Paths

1. **Resource Exhaustion**: Consuming excessive CPU, memory, or I/O resources
2. **Long-running Scans**: Initiating many concurrent or long-running scans
3. **API Flooding**: Overwhelming the Kubernetes API server with requests
4. **Scanner Process Disruption**: Interfering with scanner processes

### Mitigations

| Mitigation | Implementation | Effectiveness |
|------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Resource Limits** | CPU and memory limits on scanner containers | High |
| **Rate Limiting** | Limiting scan frequency and concurrency | Medium-High |
| **Timeouts** | Automatic termination of long-running scans | Medium |
| **Graceful Failure Handling** | Proper error handling for disrupted scans | Medium |
| **Dedicated Namespaces** | Isolation of scanner resources | Medium-High |

### Approach-Specific Considerations

| Scanning Approach | Attack Vector Exposure | Additional Mitigations |
|-------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Kubernetes API** | Low | API request throttling |
| **Debug Container** | Medium | Ephemeral container resource constraints |
| **Sidecar Container** | Medium | Pod-level resource quotas |

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

The scanning approaches help mitigate several container-related attack techniques from the MITRE ATT&CK framework:

| ATT&CK Technique | Description | Mitigations |
|------------------|-------------|------------|
| **T1610 - Deploy Container** | Attackers deploy malicious containers | Strong RBAC prevents unauthorized container deployment |
| **T1613 - Container Discovery** | Discovery of container environment | Limited visibility to container resources |
| **T1543.005 - Container Service** | Creating persistent container services | Prevents modification of container configurations |
| **T1552 - Unsecured Credentials** | Discovering credentials in containers | Short-lived tokens prevent credential theft |
| **T1611 - Container Escape** | Breaking out of container isolation | Minimal privileges and container hardening |

## Attack Surface Comparison

When comparing the attack surface of each scanning approach:

| Attack Surface Factor | Kubernetes API Approach | Debug Container Approach | Sidecar Container Approach |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Number of Components** | 🟢 Minimal | 🟠 Moderate | 🟠 Moderate |
| **Added Container Processes** | 🟢 None | 🟠 Temporary | 🔴 Permanent |
| **Required Permissions** | 🟢 Minimal | 🟠 Moderate | 🟠 Moderate |
| **Network Interfaces** | 🟢 Standard API only | 🟢 Standard API only | 🟢 Standard API only |
| **Duration of Exposure** | 🟢 Scan duration only | 🟠 Scan duration plus setup | 🔴 Pod lifetime |
