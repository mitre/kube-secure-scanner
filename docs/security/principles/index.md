# Security Principles

This document outlines the core security principles implemented in the Secure CINC Auditor Kubernetes Container Scanning platform.

## Overview

Our solution is built on several fundamental security principles that ensure a strong security posture for container scanning operations:

- **Least Privilege Access**: Using minimal permissions needed for container scanning
- **Ephemeral Credentials**: Employing short-lived tokens (default 15-minute lifespan)
- **Resource Isolation**: Restricting access to specific namespaces and resources
- **Secure Transport**: Ensuring all communications are encrypted
- **Defense in Depth**: Implementing multiple layers of security controls

## Core Security Principles

Each security principle is documented in detail:

- [Least Privilege](least-privilege.md) - Implementation of minimal permissions
- [Ephemeral Credentials](ephemeral-creds.md) - Using temporary, short-lived tokens
- [Resource Isolation](resource-isolation.md) - Separating scanning resources
- [Secure Transport](secure-transport.md) - Ensuring all communications are encrypted

## Security by Design

These principles are integrated into the design of all components and approaches:

1. **Service accounts** have minimal permissions
2. **Roles** are scoped to specific containers, not entire namespaces
3. **Access** is limited to only required verbs ("get", "list", "create" for exec)
4. **Tokens** are short-lived and automatically expire
5. **Namespaces** isolate scanning operations
