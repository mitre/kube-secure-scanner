# Security Considerations

This document outlines the security design principles of the secure InSpec container scanning solution.

## Core Security Principles

### 1. Principle of Least Privilege

All components follow the principle of least privilege:

- Service accounts have minimal permissions
- Roles are scoped to specific containers, not entire namespaces
- Only required verbs ("get", "list", "create" for exec) are granted
- No cluster-wide permissions are used

### 2. Ephemeral Credentials

- Short-lived tokens are generated for each scan
- Token expiration can be configured (default: 1 hour)
- No long-lived tokens stored in CI/CD variables or config files

### 3. Resource Isolation

- Each scan operates within a specific namespace
- Only specifically named pods can be accessed
- No access to other cluster resources
- Option for dedicated namespaces per CI/CD pipeline

### 4. Secure Transport

- All API communication uses TLS
- Kubeconfig files include the cluster's certificate authority data
- No insecure TLS options are enabled

## Threat Mitigation

### Mitigating Token Exposure

If a token is exposed, the attacker can only:

1. List pods in the target namespace
2. Execute commands in specifically allowed containers
3. View logs of specifically allowed containers

The token cannot be used to:

1. Create, modify, or delete any resources
2. Access any other containers
3. Access any cluster-wide information
4. Escalate privileges

### Preventing Lateral Movement

The RBAC configuration prevents lateral movement:

- No access to secrets
- No access to configmaps
- No ability to create new resources
- No ability to modify service accounts

## Security Recommendations

1. **Namespace Isolation**: Use dedicated namespaces for your scanning infrastructure
2. **Regular Rotation**: Regenerate service accounts and roles periodically
3. **CI/CD Variables**: Mask any generated tokens in CI/CD variables
4. **Audit Logging**: Enable audit logging in your Kubernetes cluster
5. **Time-bound Tokens**: Configure token expiration appropriately for your security requirements

## Compliance Considerations

This setup helps meet compliance requirements by:

- Providing audit trails of container scanning
- Implementing least privilege access
- Ensuring separation of duties
- Supporting temporary credential models

For specific compliance frameworks (e.g., SOC2, FedRAMP), additional controls may be required as documented in the relevant compliance guides.
