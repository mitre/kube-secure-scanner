# Security Risk Model

This document outlines the risk assessment methodology and framework used to evaluate security risks for the Secure CINC Auditor Kubernetes Container Scanning solution.

## Risk Assessment Methodology

Our security risk assessment follows a structured methodology:

1. **Identify Assets**: Identify the key assets and components being protected
2. **Threat Modeling**: Identify potential threats to those assets
3. **Vulnerability Analysis**: Evaluate vulnerabilities in the system
4. **Risk Calculation**: Calculate risk based on likelihood and impact
5. **Mitigation Strategies**: Define controls to reduce identified risks
6. **Residual Risk Assessment**: Evaluate remaining risk after mitigation

## Risk Classification Framework

### Likelihood Ratings

| Rating | Description | Criteria |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Very Low** | Highly unlikely to occur | Requires advanced capabilities, multiple failures of controls, or insider knowledge |
| **Low** | Unlikely but possible | Requires specialized knowledge, deliberate action, and partial control failures |
| **Medium** | Reasonably possible | Could occur with moderate effort, common security mistakes, or partial controls |
| **High** | Likely to occur | Could occur with minimal effort, using known techniques, or basic security knowledge |
| **Very High** | Almost certain to occur | Will occur with basic capabilities, minimal security knowledge, or common attack patterns |

### Impact Ratings

| Rating | Description | Criteria |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Very Low** | Minimal impact | No sensitive data exposure, minimal operational disruption, easily remediated |
| **Low** | Limited impact | Minor sensitive data exposure, limited operational impact, remediated with routine measures |
| **Medium** | Moderate impact | Moderate sensitive data exposure, noticeable operational impact, requires formal response |
| **High** | Significant impact | Significant sensitive data exposure, substantial operational disruption, requires incident response |
| **Very High** | Severe impact | Critical sensitive data exposure, severe operational disruption, significant business impact |

### Risk Matrix

| Likelihood/Impact | Very Low | Low | Medium | High | Very High |
|-------------------|----------|-----|--------|------|-----------|
| **Very Low** | Minimal | Minimal | Low | Low | Medium |
| **Low** | Minimal | Low | Medium | Medium | High |
| **Medium** | Low | Medium | Medium | High | High |
| **High** | Low | Medium | High | High | Critical |
| **Very High** | Medium | High | High | Critical | Critical |

## Risk Acceptance Thresholds

| Risk Level | Description | Required Action |
|------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Minimal** | Acceptable risk | No action required, routine monitoring |
| **Low** | Generally acceptable risk | Standard controls, regular review |
| **Medium** | Attention required | Enhanced controls, documented mitigation |
| **High** | Significant risk | Substantial controls, formal risk acceptance |
| **Critical** | Unacceptable risk | Must be mitigated before deployment |

## Assets Under Evaluation

The key assets evaluated in our risk assessment include:

1. **Target Containers**: The containers being scanned
2. **Kubernetes API Server**: The API interface for Kubernetes operations
3. **Service Account Tokens**: Authentication credentials
4. **Scanner Components**: Software components performing scanning
5. **Scan Results**: Output data from scanning operations
6. **Kubernetes RBAC**: Authorization configuration

## Threat Actors and Capabilities

Our risk assessment considers various threat actors:

1. **External Attackers**: Actors without internal access
2. **Malicious Insiders**: Actors with some level of legitimate access
3. **Compromised CI/CD Systems**: Build systems under attacker control
4. **Compromised Cluster Components**: Kubernetes components under attacker control

## Risk Categories

Risks are categorized into the following areas:

1. **Authentication and Authorization Risks**: Related to access control
2. **Container Security Risks**: Related to container isolation and integrity
3. **Operational Risks**: Related to scanning operations
4. **Data Risks**: Related to scan data and results
5. **Infrastructure Risks**: Related to Kubernetes and underlying infrastructure

## Risk Evaluation Process

Each scanning approach undergoes a systematic risk evaluation process:

1. **Component Identification**: Identify all components and interfaces
2. **Privilege Analysis**: Analyze required permissions and access levels
3. **Attack Surface Mapping**: Map potential attack vectors
4. **Threat Scenario Development**: Create realistic attack scenarios
5. **Control Evaluation**: Assess existing security controls
6. **Gap Analysis**: Identify control gaps and weaknesses
7. **Risk Determination**: Calculate final risk ratings

## Documentation Standards

Risk assessment documentation includes:

1. **Risk Identification**: Clear description of each risk
2. **Likelihood and Impact**: Ratings with justification
3. **Existing Controls**: Currently implemented mitigations
4. **Gaps**: Identified control weaknesses
5. **Recommended Mitigations**: Additional controls needed
6. **Residual Risk**: Expected risk level after mitigations
7. **Acceptance Criteria**: Requirements for accepting residual risk
