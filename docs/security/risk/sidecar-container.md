# Sidecar Container Approach Security Risk Analysis

This document provides a detailed security risk analysis of the Sidecar Container approach to container scanning, which uses shared process namespace between containers in the same pod.

## Security Model

The Sidecar Container approach modifies pod definitions to enable shared process namespace, allowing a scanner container to access the target container's processes and filesystem.

### Security Characteristics

| Security Factor | Rating | Description |
|-----------------|--------|-------------|
| **Required Privileges** | ðŸŸ  Moderate | Requires process namespace sharing privileges |
| **Attack Surface** | ðŸŸ  Moderate | Permanently increased during pod lifetime |
| **Credential Exposure** | ðŸŸ¢ Minimal | Uses short-lived service account tokens |
| **Isolation Level** | ðŸ”´ Lower | Permanently breaks container isolation |
| **Persistence Risk** | ðŸŸ  Moderate | Container persists during pod lifetime |

## Detailed Risk Assessment

### Authentication and Authorization Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Token leakage | Low | Medium | Short-lived tokens, minimal permissions |
| Excessive permissions | Medium | Medium | Careful RBAC implementation |
| Authentication bypass | Very Low | High | Standard Kubernetes authentication mechanisms |

### Operational Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Sidecar persistence | High | Medium | Container remains throughout pod lifecycle |
| Resource contention | Medium | Medium | Resource limits on sidecar containers |
| Container interference | Medium | High | Process and filesystem isolation broken |

### Container Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Container isolation breach | High | High | Permanent process namespace sharing |
| Sidecar container compromise | Medium | High | Could affect target container |
| Data exfiltration | Medium | Medium | Shared process space increases risk |

## Risk Comparison

When compared to other scanning approaches, the Sidecar Container approach presents:

- **Higher risk** than the Kubernetes API approach in terms of isolation, persistence, and container security principles
- **Higher risk** than the Debug Container approach in terms of persistence and isolation duration

## Risk Scenarios and Mitigations

### Scenario 1: Sidecar to Target Container Access

**Risk**: The sidecar container accesses or interferes with the target container processes.

**Mitigations**:

1. Sidecar container runs with minimal privileges
2. Read-only filesystem access
3. Non-root user execution
4. Resource limits prevent denial of service

**Residual Risk**: Medium-High - The shared process namespace fundamentally allows access between containers.

### Scenario 2: Process Manipulation

**Risk**: Sidecar container manipulates processes in the target container.

**Mitigations**:

1. Non-privileged sidecar execution
2. Process visibility only (limited manipulation capability)
3. Security policies to restrict capabilities
4. Monitoring for unexpected process activities

**Residual Risk**: Medium - Process visibility doesn't necessarily grant full manipulation capabilities, but the risk remains higher than other approaches.

### Scenario 3: Sidecar Container Compromise

**Risk**: The sidecar container itself is compromised during operation.

**Mitigations**:

1. Minimal tools and packages in sidecar container
2. Non-privileged execution
3. Limited network access
4. Container security hardening

**Residual Risk**: Medium-High - A compromised sidecar has access to the target container's processes and filesystem.

## Enterprise Security Considerations

For enterprise deployments:

1. **Strict Pod Selection**: Limit sidecar deployment to specific, non-sensitive applications
2. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Implement detailed monitoring of sidecar containers
3. **Network Isolation**: Apply strict network policies to sidecar-enabled pods
4. **Container Hardening**: Use minimal, hardened images for sidecar containers
5. **Regular Security Reassessment**: More frequent security reviews for sidecar deployments

## Conclusion

The Sidecar Container approach presents the highest security risk profile among the available container scanning approaches. Its permanent breaking of container isolation principles and persistence throughout the pod lifecycle represent significant departures from container security best practices.

While the approach provides universal container scanning capability (working with both standard and distroless containers), its security implications make it suitable only when other approaches are not viable, and with significant additional security controls in place.

For security-sensitive environments, the Sidecar Container approach should be considered only as a last resort, with full documentation of the security implications, formal risk acceptance, and enhanced security monitoring.
