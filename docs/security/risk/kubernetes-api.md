# Kubernetes API Approach Security Risk Analysis

This document provides a detailed security risk analysis of the Kubernetes API approach to container scanning, which uses the train-k8s-container transport plugin.

## Security Model

The Kubernetes API approach uses the Kubernetes API server to execute commands within target containers.

### Security Characteristics

| Security Factor | Rating | Description |
|-----------------|--------|-------------|
| **Required Privileges** | 游릭 Low | Only requires pod "get", "list", and "exec" permissions |
| **Attack Surface** | 游릭 Minimal | Uses standard Kubernetes API only |
| **Credential Exposure** | 游릭 Minimal | Uses short-lived service account tokens |
| **Isolation Level** | 游릭 High | Preserves container isolation |
| **Persistence Risk** | 游릭 None | Stateless operation with no persistent components |

## Detailed Risk Assessment

### Authentication and Authorization Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Token leakage | Low | Medium | Short-lived tokens, minimal permissions |
| Excessive permissions | Low | Medium | Least privilege RBAC implementation |
| Authentication bypass | Very Low | High | Standard Kubernetes authentication mechanisms |

### Operational Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Command injection | Low | Medium | Input validation, limited command execution |
| Resource exhaustion | Low | Low | Resource limits on scanner activities |
| Scan disruption | Medium | Low | Retry mechanisms, graceful error handling |

### Container Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Container compromise | Very Low | Medium | Restricted command execution, minimal privileges |
| Container interference | Low | Medium | No modification of container state |
| Data exfiltration | Low | Medium | Limited access to container contents |

## Risk Comparison

When compared to other scanning approaches, the Kubernetes API approach presents:

- **Lower risk** than the Debug Container approach in terms of required privileges and attack surface
- **Lower risk** than the Sidecar Container approach in terms of isolation preservation and container security principles

## Risk Scenarios and Mitigations

### Scenario 1: Token Compromise

**Risk**: An attacker obtains a scanner's service account token.

**Mitigations**:

1. Token is short-lived (default 15-minute expiration)
2. Token has minimal permissions (only specific pods)
3. Token can only execute commands, not modify resources
4. Comprehensive audit logging of all API operations

**Residual Risk**: Low - Even with a compromised token, an attacker's capabilities are severely limited in both scope and time.

### Scenario 2: Scanner Process Compromise

**Risk**: The scanner process itself is compromised during operation.

**Mitigations**:

1. Scanner has minimal Kubernetes permissions
2. Scanner operates for a limited duration
3. No persistent access to cluster
4. No ability to modify cluster resources

**Residual Risk**: Low to Medium - A compromised scanner has limited ability to affect the broader cluster.

### Scenario 3: Command Injection

**Risk**: Malicious input causes unexpected command execution.

**Mitigations**:

1. Input validation for all parameters
2. Restricted command execution capabilities
3. Non-privileged command execution
4. Container isolation remains intact

**Residual Risk**: Low - Command execution is constrained by container context and permissions.

## Enterprise Security Considerations

For enterprise deployments:

1. **Audit Logging**: Enable comprehensive Kubernetes audit logging
2. **Token Management**: Implement proper token lifecycle management
3. **Scanner Verification**: Verify scanner container integrity before deployment
4. **Network Policies**: Implement network policies to restrict scanner communication
5. **Monitoring**: Monitor for unexpected scanning operations

## Conclusion

The Kubernetes API approach presents the lowest overall security risk profile among the available container scanning approaches. Its use of standard Kubernetes interfaces, minimal permissions, and preservation of container isolation principles makes it the preferred choice for security-conscious environments.

The approach maintains strong security boundaries while still providing effective container scanning capabilities. Its primary limitation is the requirement for containers to have shell access, which is addressed by alternative approaches for distroless containers.
