# Security Risk Analysis

This document provides an overview of the security risk analysis for the Secure CINC Auditor Kubernetes Container Scanning platform.

## Introduction

Understanding the security risks associated with container scanning is essential for implementing effective controls and selecting the most appropriate approach for your environment. This section provides a comprehensive security risk analysis for all scanning approaches.

## Risk Analysis by Approach

Each container scanning approach has different security characteristics, risks, and mitigations:

- [Kubernetes API Approach](kubernetes-api.md) - Analysis of the standard scanning approach
- [Debug Container Approach](debug-container.md) - Analysis of the debug container approach
- [Sidecar Container Approach](sidecar-container.md) - Analysis of the sidecar container approach

## Risk Model and Framework

Our [Risk Model](model.md) provides the framework and methodology used to assess security risks across all scanning approaches. It includes:

- Risk assessment methodology
- Risk classification criteria
- Impact and likelihood ratings
- Risk acceptance thresholds

## Comprehensive Mitigations

[Risk Mitigations](mitigations.md) documents the strategies and controls implemented to address identified risks, including:

- Universal mitigations applied to all approaches
- Approach-specific mitigations
- Enterprise security recommendations
- Operational best practices

## Security Risk Overview

| Security Factor | Kubernetes API Approach | Debug Container Approach | Sidecar Container Approach |
|-----------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Required Privileges** | Container access | Ephemeral container creation | Process namespace sharing |
| **Attack Surface** | Minimal | Moderate | Moderate |
| **Credential Exposure** | Minimal | Minimal | Minimal |
| **Isolation Level** | High | Moderate | Lower |
| **Persistence Risk** | None (stateless) | None (ephemeral) | Container lifetime |
