# Integration Examples

This section provides practical examples of integrating the Kube CINC Secure Scanner with various CI/CD platforms.

## Overview

To help you implement container security scanning in your CI/CD pipeline, we provide concrete examples for various platforms and scanning approaches.

## Example Categories

Our integration examples are organized by platform:

- [GitHub Actions Examples](github-examples.md) - Examples for GitHub's native CI/CD service
- [GitLab CI Examples](gitlab-examples.md) - Examples for GitLab's CI/CD pipelines
- [GitLab Services Examples](index.md#gitlab-services-examples) - Examples using GitLab's Services feature (coming soon)
- [Custom Integration Examples](index.md#custom-integration-examples) - Examples for other CI/CD platforms (coming soon)

## Example Implementation Guides

Each example includes:

1. **Complete workflow definitions** ready to use in your CI/CD pipeline
2. **Step-by-step implementation instructions**
3. **Configuration options** for customizing the integration
4. **Best practices** for efficient and secure implementation

## Future Examples

### GitLab Services Examples

The upcoming GitLab Services examples will include:

- Service-oriented scanner integration
- GitLab-specific configuration for various scanning approaches
- Security best practices for GitLab Services environment

### Custom Integration Examples

Future custom integration examples will cover:

- Adapting workflows to less common CI/CD platforms
- Patterns for creating your own integrations
- Platform-agnostic strategies for container scanning
