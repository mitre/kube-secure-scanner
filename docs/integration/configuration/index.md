# Integration Configuration

This section provides documentation on configuring container scanning integrations in CI/CD environments.

## Overview

Proper configuration is essential for successful container scanning in CI/CD pipelines. This section covers various configuration aspects, including:

- **Environment Variables**: Managing configuration parameters across different environments
- **Secrets Management**: Securely handling sensitive information in CI/CD pipelines
- **Thresholds Integration**: Implementing compliance thresholds for automated quality gates
- **Reporting Configuration**: Generating and distributing scan results in various formats

## Key Configuration Considerations

When configuring container scanning in CI/CD pipelines, consider the following factors:

1. **Security**: Ensure credentials and sensitive information are properly secured
2. **Flexibility**: Allow configuration to adapt to different environments (dev, staging, prod)
3. **Maintainability**: Use consistent naming conventions and documented parameters
4. **Reproducibility**: Ensure configuration produces consistent results across runs
5. **Integration**: Enable interoperability with existing security tools and processes

## Common Configuration Patterns

The following patterns are commonly used when configuring container scanning:

### Environment-Based Configuration

Configure different scanning parameters based on the target environment:

```yaml
variables:
  # Base settings
  SCANNER_LOG_LEVEL: info
  RESULTS_DIR: ./scan-results
  
  # Environment-specific thresholds
  THRESHOLD_DEVELOP: 50
  THRESHOLD_STAGING: 70
  THRESHOLD_PRODUCTION: 90
```

### Dynamic Configuration

Adapt scanning behavior based on build parameters:

```yaml
# Determine threshold based on branch
if [ "$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH" == "main" ]; then
  THRESHOLD=$THRESHOLD_PRODUCTION
elif [ "$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH" == "staging" ]; then
  THRESHOLD=$THRESHOLD_STAGING
else
  THRESHOLD=$THRESHOLD_DEVELOP
fi
```

### Component-Specific Configuration

Apply different scanning configurations based on component type:

```yaml
# For API containers
if [[ "$CONTAINER_TYPE" == "api" ]]; then
  PROFILE="api-security-profile"
  THRESHOLD=90
# For database containers
elif [[ "$CONTAINER_TYPE" == "db" ]]; then
  PROFILE="database-security-profile"
  THRESHOLD=95
# Default configuration
else
  PROFILE="default-security-profile"
  THRESHOLD=80
fi
```
