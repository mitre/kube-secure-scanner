# Integration Configuration

This section provides detailed documentation on configuring CI/CD integrations for the Kube CINC Secure Scanner.

## Overview

Proper configuration is essential for successful integration of the Kube CINC Secure Scanner with CI/CD platforms. This section covers various configuration aspects to help you implement effective and secure CI/CD integrations.

## Configuration Areas

We provide detailed configuration guidance for the following areas:

- [Environment Variables](environment-variables.md) - Configuring environment variables for CI/CD integrations
- [Secrets Management](secrets-management.md) - Managing secrets and credentials for secure integrations
- [Thresholds Integration](thresholds-integration.md) - Configuring scan result thresholds for CI/CD pipelines
- [Results Reporting](reporting.md) - Configuring the reporting of scan results in CI/CD pipelines

## Configuration Best Practices

When configuring CI/CD integrations, follow these best practices:

1. **Secure Credentials**: Always use your CI/CD platform's secrets management
2. **Environment Isolation**: Configure separate environments for development, testing, and production
3. **Consistent Configuration**: Use consistent configuration across different environments
4. **Threshold Management**: Define appropriate thresholds for different environments
5. **Log Management**: Configure appropriate log levels and retention policies
