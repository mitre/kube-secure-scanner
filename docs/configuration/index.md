# Configuration Overview

!!! info "Directory Inventory"
    See the [Configuration Directory Inventory](inventory.md) for a complete listing of files and resources in this directory.

This section provides comprehensive documentation for configuring the Secure CINC Auditor Kubernetes Container Scanning solution.

## Configuration Areas

The configuration documentation is organized into several key areas:

1. **[Kubeconfig Configuration](kubeconfig/index.md)**: Authentication and access configuration for Kubernetes
2. **[Threshold Configuration](thresholds/index.md)**: Compliance validation and quality gates
3. **[Plugin Customization](plugins/index.md)**: Modifications to scanning plugins
4. **[Integration Configuration](integration/index.md)**: Configuration for CI/CD and other integrations
5. **[Security Configuration](security/index.md)**: Security-focused configurations

## Common Configuration Scenarios

| Scenario | Configuration Area | Description |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|
| Basic Authentication | [Kubeconfig](kubeconfig/index.md) | Setting up authentication for the scanner |
| Quality Gates | [Thresholds](thresholds/index.md) | Configuring pass/fail criteria for scans |
| Distroless Support | [Plugins](plugins/index.md) | Configuring scanning for distroless containers |
| CI/CD Pipeline | [Integration](integration/index.md) | Setting up scanner in CI/CD environments |
| Hardened Environment | [Security](security/index.md) | Security-focused configuration options |

## Getting Started

Most users should begin with the [Kubeconfig Configuration](kubeconfig/index.md) to set up basic authentication, followed by [Threshold Configuration](thresholds/index.md) to establish quality gates for compliance validation.

## Advanced Configuration

For specialized needs, explore the [Plugin Customization](plugins/index.md) documentation, which includes guidance on modifying scanner behavior for specific container types.
