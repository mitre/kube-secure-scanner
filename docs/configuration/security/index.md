This section provides documentation for security-focused configurations of the CINC Auditor container scanning solution.

## Security Configuration Overview

Security configurations ensure that the scanner operates in a secure manner and maintains appropriate access controls. Key security considerations include:

1. **Credential Management**: Secure handling of kubeconfig files and tokens
2. **RBAC Hardening**: Configuring least-privilege role-based access
3. **Network Security**: Securing network communications between components

## Security Configuration Guides

- [Hardening Configuration](hardening.md) - Security hardening recommendations
- [Credential Management](credentials.md) - Secure management of authentication credentials
- [RBAC Configuration](rbac.md) - Role-based access control for scanners

## Common Use Cases

| Use Case | Guide | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| Production Deployment | [Hardening](hardening.md) | Secure configuration for production environments |
| Sensitive Environments | [Credentials](credentials.md) | Managing credentials in high-security environments |
| Multi-tenant Clusters | [RBAC](rbac.md) | Isolating scanner access between tenants |

## Getting Started

Most users should begin with the [Hardening Configuration](hardening.md) to understand the basic security recommendations, followed by the specific guides relevant to their deployment scenario.
