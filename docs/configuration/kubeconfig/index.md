This section covers creating and managing secure kubeconfig files for InSpec container scanning.

## What is a Kubeconfig?

A kubeconfig file is a Kubernetes configuration file that provides client programs with the information needed to connect to a Kubernetes cluster. It contains:

- Cluster information (API server address, certificate authority)
- User authentication details (tokens, client certificates)
- Context definitions (combinations of cluster, user, and namespace)

## Key Components

A kubeconfig file for InSpec scanning contains:

1. **[Cluster configuration](generation.md#cluster-section)**: Server address and certificate authority
2. **[User authentication](generation.md#user-section)**: Service account token
3. **[Context](generation.md#context-section)**: Binding a cluster and user with a namespace

## Common Use Cases

| Use Case | Guide | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| Basic Setup | [Generation](generation.md#manual-generation) | Generate a basic kubeconfig file for scanning |
| CI/CD Pipelines | [Dynamic Configuration](dynamic.md) | Generate kubeconfig files dynamically |
| Multiple Environments | [Management](management.md#multiple-environments) | Manage kubeconfig files for different environments |
| Secure Handling | [Security](security.md) | Secure handling of kubeconfig files |

## Testing Your Configuration

Once you have created a kubeconfig file, you can [test it](generation.md#testing-a-kubeconfig) to ensure it works correctly.
