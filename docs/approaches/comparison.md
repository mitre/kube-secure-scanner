# Scanning Approach Comparison

This document provides a comprehensive comparison of the three container scanning approaches implemented in this project. This analysis will help you select the most appropriate approach based on your specific environment, requirements, and constraints.

## Approach Overview

| Approach | Description | Best For |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Kubernetes API Approach** | Uses the train-k8s-container plugin to directly interact with containers through the Kubernetes API | **Enterprise production environments, security/compliance-focused organizations, CI/CD pipelines at scale** |
| **Debug Container Approach** | Attaches ephemeral debug containers to pods with distroless containers | *Interim solution* for distroless containers when ephemeral containers are supported |
| **Sidecar Container Approach** | Deploys scanner containers alongside target containers with shared process namespace | *Interim solution* for distroless containers with minimal Kubernetes version requirements |

## Feature Comparison Matrix

| Feature | Kubernetes API Approach | Debug Container Approach | Sidecar Container Approach |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Kubernetes Compatibility** | Any version | 1.16+ (requires ephemeral containers) | Any version |
| **Works with existing pods** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (requires pod modification) |
| **Standard container support** | ✅ Best approach | ✅ Supported | ✅ Supported |
| **Distroless container support** | 🔄 In progress | ✅ Best interim approach | ✅ Supported |
| **No pod modification required** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **Minimal privileges** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Implementation complexity** | 🟢 Low | 🟠 Medium | 🟠 Medium |
| **User experience** | 🟢 Seamless | 🟠 Complex | 🟠 Medium |
| **Security footprint** | 🟢 Minimal | 🟠 Moderate | 🟠 Moderate |
| **Runtime dependencies** | kubectl, inspec | kubectl, ephemeral containers | kubectl, pod access |
| **CI/CD integration ease** | 🟢 Simple | 🟠 Complex | 🟠 Medium |
| **Development status** | 🔄 In progress (for distroless) | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete |
| **GitHub Actions support** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **GitLab CI support** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **GitLab Services support** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |

## Technical Requirements

### Kubernetes API Approach
- Standard Kubernetes cluster (any version)
- RBAC permissions to execute commands in target containers
- For distroless containers: Enhanced plugin capabilities (in development)

### Debug Container Approach
- Kubernetes 1.16+ with ephemeral containers feature enabled
- Permissions to create debug containers
- Privileges to access target container filesystem

### Sidecar Container Approach
- Standard Kubernetes cluster (any version)
- Ability to modify pod definitions to enable shared process namespace
- Permissions to create pods with sidecar containers

## Recommended Usage Scenarios

### Enterprise Production Environments
**Recommended Approach**: Kubernetes API Approach

- Lowest security risk profile
- Simplest implementation with minimal overhead
- Most transparent to end users
- Minimal permissions required in production clusters
- Best for multi-team environments

### Distroless Containers (Interim)
**Recommended Approach**: Debug Container or Sidecar Container Approach

- If on Kubernetes 1.16+: Debug Container Approach
- If needing universal compatibility: Sidecar Container Approach
- Long-term: Plan for migration to Kubernetes API Approach as distroless support matures

### Local Development and Testing
**Recommended Approach**: Any approach depending on container types

- For standard containers: Kubernetes API Approach is simplest
- For mixed container types: Sidecar Container Approach is most flexible

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration
**Recommended Approach**: Any approach, depending on container types

- All approaches work well with CI/CD pipelines
- For standard containers, Kubernetes API Approach is preferred
- For distroless containers, choose based on environment capabilities

## Migration Paths

### To Kubernetes API Approach (Recommended)
- For standard containers: Immediate adoption
- For distroless containers: Plan adoption as enhanced distroless support is completed
- Maintain same commands and workflows for consistent user experience

### Between Approaches
- Debug Container to Sidecar: Modify pod definitions to enable shared process
- Sidecar to Debug Container: Ensure cluster supports ephemeral containers
- Either to Kubernetes API: Wait for distroless support completion

## Enterprise Adoption Strategy

For enterprise environments implementing container scanning at scale:

1. **Phase 1: Standard Containers**
   - Implement Kubernetes API Approach for all standard containers
   - Document and train teams on standardized workflow

2. **Phase 2: Distroless Containers (Interim)**
   - Implement appropriate fallback based on environment
   - Document temporary approach and plan for migration

3. **Phase 3: Complete Migration**
   - Migrate all scanning to Kubernetes API Approach once distroless support is complete
   - Standardize on universal approach for all container types
