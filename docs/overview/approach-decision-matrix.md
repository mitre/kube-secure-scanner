## Detailed Analysis by Use Case

### Use Case 1: Standard Development Environment

**Best Approach**: Standard Container Scanning

**Rationale**:
- Simple implementation with minimal overhead
- Works well for most development containers (which typically include shell)
- Lowest security risk profile
- Easiest for developers to understand and implement
- Minimal permissions required in development clusters

### Use Case 2: Production with Mixed Container Types

**Best Approach**: Sidecar Container Approach

**Rationale**:
- Universal compatibility with all container types
- Works regardless of Kubernetes version
- Consistent approach across standard and distroless containers
- Can be implemented with automated sidecar injection

### Use Case 3: Advanced Kubernetes Environment (1.16+)

**Best Approach**: Debug Container Approach

**Rationale**:
- Utilizes native Kubernetes ephemeral containers feature
- More isolated than sidecar approach
- Debug containers are ephemeral (removed after scan)
- Good balance of security and capabilities

### Use Case 4: Highly Secure / Zero-Trust Environment

**Best Approach**: Standard Scanning (with fallback to Debug Container)

**Rationale**:
- Standard scanning has the lowest risk profile
- Minimal permissions required
- Minimal attack surface
- If distroless containers are required, use Debug Container approach with strict controls

### Use Case 5: CI/CD Pipeline Integration

**Best Approach**: Any approach, depending on container types

**Rationale**:
- All approaches work well with CI/CD pipelines
- Choose based on container types being scanned
- If unknown container types, sidecar approach provides most flexibility
- Guidelines provided for GitLab CI and GitHub Actions for all approaches

## Implementation Decision Tree

1. **Are you scanning standard containers with shell access?**
   - **Yes**: Use Standard Container Scanning
   - **No**: Continue to next question

2. **Are you on Kubernetes 1.16+ with ephemeral containers enabled?**
   - **Yes**: Use Debug Container Approach
   - **No**: Continue to next question

3. **Can you modify pod definitions to add shareProcessNamespace?**
   - **Yes**: Use Sidecar Container Approach
   - **No**: Consider cluster upgrade to enable ephemeral containers

4. **Is security your primary concern?**
   - **Yes**: Use Standard Scanning where possible, with strict controls on any alternate approach
   - **No**: Choose based on compatibility and operational factors

## Migration Paths

### From Standard to Debug Container
- Implement ephemeral container support in cluster
- Add debug container configuration
- Modify scan scripts to use debug container method

### From Standard to Sidecar Container
- Modify pod definitions to enable shareProcessNamespace
- Add sidecar container configuration
- Configure process detection and filesystem access

### From Debug Container to Sidecar Container
- Modify pod definitions to enable shareProcessNamespace
- Configure sidecar deployment approach
- No cluster version dependencies
