Each scanning approach has distinct characteristics that impact enterprise integration. The Kubernetes API Approach offers the simplest integration path with lowest overhead and will become the universal solution once distroless support is implemented. The Debug Container and Sidecar Container approaches provide interim solutions for distroless containers, but with increased complexity.

For most enterprises, a strategic phased approach is recommended:

1. **Current State (Transition Period):**
   - Use Kubernetes API Approach for all standard containers
   - Use either Debug Container or Sidecar Container approach temporarily for distroless containers
   - Implement consistent tooling and reporting across all approaches

2. **Target State (Long-term):**
   - Migrate to the Kubernetes API Approach as the universal solution for all container types
   - Benefit from simplified operations, consistent user experience, and lower costs
   - Maintain a single approach for enterprise-wide container scanning
   - Achieve high alignment with industry security standards and frameworks

This analysis provides a foundation for planning enterprise integration of container scanning approaches, considering various factors that impact successful adoption and long-term sustainability, with a clear path toward the recommended Kubernetes API Approach as the universal solution.
