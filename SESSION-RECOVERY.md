# Session Recovery Document

This document helps maintain context between sessions when working on the secure container scanning project.

## Documentation Reorganization Progress Summary (Updated March 25, 2025)

We've been implementing a comprehensive documentation reorganization to improve usability and maintainability following a consistent pattern:
- Breaking large documents into focused subdirectories with dedicated content files
- Creating standardized index.md and inventory.md files for each subdirectory
- Updating navigation to reflect the new structure
- Maintaining cross-references between related topics

### Completed Reorganization:
- âœ… Approaches section - Restructured into subdirectories by approach type with focused content files
- âœ… Security section - Restructured into principles/, risk/, compliance/, threat-model/, and recommendations/
- âœ… Deployment scenarios - Already reorganized with subdirectories
- âœ… Advanced topics - Already reorganized with subdirectories
- âœ… Helm Charts - Reorganized into overview/, scanner-types/, infrastructure/, usage/, security/, and operations/
- âœ… Configuration - Reorganized into kubeconfig/, thresholds/, plugins/, integration/, and security/
- âœ… Architecture - Reorganized into components/, workflows/, diagrams/, deployment/, and integrations/
- âœ… Integration - Reorganized into platforms/, workflows/, examples/, and configuration/

### Next Steps:
1. Complete remaining Integration section files (create gitlab-examples.md, configuration files)
2. Continue Phase 4 (review and refinement) of documentation refactoring
3. Address remaining documentation gaps
4. Implement documentation validation tools

## Current Project State (Updated March 25, 2025)

## Key Decisions and Latest Status

1. **Container Scanning Approaches**:
   - **Standard Containers**: Using train-k8s-container transport plugin (stable)
   - **Distroless Containers**: Three distinct approaches implemented
     - Debug container approach with chroot (requires ephemeral containers feature)
     - Sidecar container approach with shared process namespace (works universally)
     - Modified transport plugin approach (in progress, most transparent to users)

2. **CI/CD Integration**: 
   - Multiple implementation strategies for each approach
   - GitLab CI standard, GitLab CI with services, and GitHub Actions
   - Comprehensive examples for all scanning approaches
   - Shared volume and configuration approach for results collection

3. **Security First**:
   - CINC Auditor (open-source InSpec) to avoid licensing issues
   - MITRE SAF-CLI for results processing and threshold validation
   - Supporting both label-based and name-based RBAC approaches
   - Using short-lived tokens (default 15 minutes) for security
   - Least privilege principle applied throughout all implementations

4. **Deployment and Configuration**:
   - Shell scripts for direct usage and testing
   - Modular Helm charts for production deployment
   - Comprehensive configuration options and examples
   - YAML-based threshold files for compliance validation
