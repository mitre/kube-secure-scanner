# Session Recovery Document

This document helps maintain context between sessions when working on the secure container scanning project.

## Current Project State

We've created a comprehensive project structure for secure Kubernetes container scanning using CINC Auditor (open-source InSpec) with the train-k8s-container transport. The project demonstrates how to implement least-privilege RBAC to minimize security risk.

### Completed Components

1. **Documentation**
   - Comprehensive guides organized by topic (RBAC, service accounts, tokens, etc.)
   - Detailed integration guides for CI/CD pipelines
   - SAF CLI integration documentation
   - Threshold configuration guide

2. **Kubernetes Resources**
   - YAML templates for namespace, service accounts, RBAC
   - Label-based and name-based RBAC examples

3. **Automation Scripts**
   - kubeconfig generation script
   - Container scanning wrapper script with SAF CLI integration
   - Proper threshold file handling

4. **Helm Chart**
   - Templates for all required resources
   - Configurable values.yaml with SAF CLI settings
   - Helper scripts deployed as configmaps

## Important Notes for Future Sessions

### Distroless Container Scanning Approaches: User Experience Considerations

When analyzing our two approaches for distroless container scanning, we need to consider the end-user experience, especially since our solution needs to scale to many teams conducting frequent scans:

**Approach 1: Modified train-k8s-container Plugin**
- **User Experience Benefits:**
  - Most transparent to end users - they use the exact same commands as with regular containers
  - No additional knowledge required by teams
  - Scales easily across many teams
  - Teams don't need to understand the underlying mechanics
  - Consistent experience regardless of container type
- **Adoption Considerations:**
  - Easier organizational adoption due to consistent workflow
  - Lower training burden
  - Better for multi-team environments

**Approach 2: Direct chroot Approach**
- **User Experience Challenges:**
  - Requires specialized debug containers
  - May require different commands or workflows for distroless vs. regular containers
  - More complexity visible to end users
  - Potentially more friction for wide adoption
  - Teams need to understand more about the underlying mechanism

From a user experience and scalability perspective, Approach 1 (plugin modification) offers superior transparency and consistency, which is critical for wide adoption across multiple teams.

### Technical Correction for Chroot Approach
We've identified an important correction for the direct chroot approach to scanning distroless containers:

1. CINC Auditor/InSpec is not a simple binary but requires a full Ruby environment with dependencies
2. The debug container would need to have Ruby, required gems, and all CINC Auditor dependencies
3. A proper implementation would likely be based on a custom Docker image similar to:
   - https://gitlab.com/cinc-project/docker-images/-/blob/master/docker-auditor/Dockerfile
   - https://gitlab.com/cinc-project/docker-images/-/blob/master/docker-auditor/Gemfile

When we update the documentation, we'll need to revise the chroot approach to either:
- Use a pre-built CINC Auditor container as the debug container
- Include instructions for building a proper debug container with all Ruby dependencies
- Explore alternative methods that account for InSpec's Ruby environment requirements
