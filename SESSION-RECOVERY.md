# Session Recovery Document

This document helps maintain context between sessions when working on the secure container scanning project.

## Documentation Reorganization Progress Summary (Updated March 25, 2025)

We've been implementing a comprehensive documentation reorganization to improve usability and maintainability following a consistent pattern:
- Breaking large documents into focused subdirectories with dedicated content files
- Creating standardized index.md and inventory.md files for each subdirectory
- Updating navigation to reflect the new structure
- Maintaining cross-references between related topics

### Completed Reorganization:
- âœ… Approaches section - Restructured into subdirectories by approach type with focused content files
- âœ… Security section - Restructured into principles/, risk/, compliance/, threat-model/, and recommendations/
- âœ… Deployment scenarios - Already reorganized with subdirectories
- âœ… Advanced topics - Already reorganized with subdirectories
- âœ… Helm Charts - Reorganized into overview/, scanner-types/, infrastructure/, usage/, security/, and operations/
- âœ… Configuration - Reorganized into kubeconfig/, thresholds/, plugins/, integration/, and security/

### Planned for Reorganization:
- ðŸ“… Architecture - Medium priority
- ðŸ“… Integration - Medium priority

### Next Steps:
1. Begin the Architecture section reorganization
2. Continue Phase 4 (review and refinement) of documentation refactoring
3. Address remaining documentation gaps
4. Implement documentation validation tools

## Current Project State (Updated March 24, 2025)

We've created a comprehensive project structure for secure Kubernetes container scanning using CINC Auditor (open-source InSpec) with the train-k8s-container transport. The project demonstrates how to implement least-privilege RBAC to minimize security risk.

### Completed Components

1. **Documentation**
   - Comprehensive guides organized by topic (RBAC, service accounts, tokens, etc.)
   - Detailed integration guides for CI/CD pipelines
   - SAF CLI integration documentation
   - Threshold configuration guide

2. **Kubernetes Resources**
   - YAML templates for namespace, service accounts, RBAC
   - Label-based and name-based RBAC examples

3. **Automation Scripts**
   - kubeconfig generation script
   - Container scanning wrapper script with SAF CLI integration
   - Proper threshold file handling

4. **Helm Chart**
   - Templates for all required resources
   - Configurable values.yaml with SAF CLI settings
   - Helper scripts deployed as configmaps
   - Threshold configuration support

5. **GitHub Workflows**
   - Basic setup and scan workflow
   - Dynamic RBAC scanning workflow
   - CI/CD pipeline workflow
   - All properly integrated with MITRE SAF-CLI threshold validation

6. **CINC Profiles**
   - Example container baseline profile

7. **GitLab Integration**
   - Dedicated gitlab-examples directory
   - Complete GitLab CI pipeline example

### Latest Updates

## Key Decisions and Latest Status

1. **Container Scanning Approaches**:
   - **Standard Containers**: Using train-k8s-container transport plugin (stable)
   - **Distroless Containers**: Three distinct approaches implemented
     - Debug container approach with chroot (requires ephemeral containers feature)
     - Sidecar container approach with shared process namespace (works universally)
     - Modified transport plugin approach (in progress, most transparent to users)

2. **CI/CD Integration**: 
   - Multiple implementation strategies for each approach
   - GitLab CI standard, GitLab CI with services, and GitHub Actions
   - Comprehensive examples for all scanning approaches
   - Shared volume and configuration approach for results collection

3. **Security First**:
   - CINC Auditor (open-source InSpec) to avoid licensing issues
   - MITRE SAF-CLI for results processing and threshold validation
   - Supporting both label-based and name-based RBAC approaches
   - Using short-lived tokens (default 15 minutes) for security
   - Least privilege principle applied throughout all implementations

4. **Deployment and Configuration**:
   - Shell scripts for direct usage and testing
   - Modular Helm charts for production deployment
   - Comprehensive configuration options and examples
   - YAML-based threshold files for compliance validation
