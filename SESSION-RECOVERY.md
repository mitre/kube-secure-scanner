## Important Notes for Future Sessions

### Distroless Container Scanning Approaches: User Experience Considerations

When analyzing our two approaches for distroless container scanning, we need to consider the end-user experience, especially since our solution needs to scale to many teams conducting frequent scans:

**Approach 1: Modified train-k8s-container Plugin**
- **User Experience Benefits:**
  - Most transparent to end users - they use the exact same commands as with regular containers
  - No additional knowledge required by teams
  - Scales easily across many teams
  - Teams don't need to understand the underlying mechanics
  - Consistent experience regardless of container type
- **Adoption Considerations:**
  - Easier organizational adoption due to consistent workflow
  - Lower training burden
  - Better for multi-team environments

**Approach 2: Direct chroot Approach**
- **User Experience Challenges:**
  - Requires specialized debug containers
  - May require different commands or workflows for distroless vs. regular containers
  - More complexity visible to end users
  - Potentially more friction for wide adoption
  - Teams need to understand more about the underlying mechanism

From a user experience and scalability perspective, Approach 1 (plugin modification) offers superior transparency and consistency, which is critical for wide adoption across multiple teams.

### Technical Correction for Chroot Approach
We've identified an important correction for the direct chroot approach to scanning distroless containers:

1. CINC Auditor/InSpec is not a simple binary but requires a full Ruby environment with dependencies
2. The debug container would need to have Ruby, required gems, and all CINC Auditor dependencies
3. A proper implementation would likely be based on a custom Docker image similar to:
   - https://gitlab.com/cinc-project/docker-images/-/blob/master/docker-auditor/Dockerfile
   - https://gitlab.com/cinc-project/docker-images/-/blob/master/docker-auditor/Gemfile

When we update the documentation, we'll need to revise the chroot approach to either:
- Use a pre-built CINC Auditor container as the debug container
- Include instructions for building a proper debug container with all Ruby dependencies
- Explore alternative methods that account for InSpec's Ruby environment requirements
