### Current Documentation Structure
- Documentation has a multi-layered approach:
  - Getting Started section with security content elevated
  - Learning Paths section for guided implementation
  - Common Tasks section for frequently performed operations
  - Deployment Scenarios section for specific environments
  - Technical Documentation section with comprehensive references
  - Reference section with consolidated configuration details

### Identified Documentation Gaps
- We identified a gap in Kubernetes setup documentation that needed a three-part structure:
  1. General Kubernetes setup best practices and guidelines
  2. Setup requirements for existing Kubernetes clusters
  3. Setup and configuration of Minikube for local evaluation
- We've now filled this gap with comprehensive documentation in the kubernetes-setup/ directory
  
### Next Steps
1. Continue with Phase 4 of the documentation reorganization plan: Navigation Aids and Cross-Links
   - Extend cross-references to all remaining learning path pages:
     - Add "Related Tasks" sections to all learning paths
     - Add "Related Learning Paths" sections to all task pages
   - Implement "Related Content" sections in each major documentation page:
     - Focus on technical content connections
     - Prioritize security content connections second
   - Add breadcrumb navigation to improve navigation between related sections
   - Implement visual navigation aids like diagrams and maps
   - Update the site index with additional visual enhancements and organization
   - Add tag system for major content categories

2. Address remaining conceptual and documentation gaps:
   - **Security and Compliance Alignment**:
     - "Close the loop" between scanning approaches and compliance requirements
     - Document how each approach maps to specific compliance controls
     - Analyze risk implications of each approach
     - Create a clear matrix showing approach â†” compliance â†” risk relationships
   
   - **Example Status Disclaimer**:
     - Add prominent notices at the top of project documentation
     - Clearly indicate which examples are reference-only vs. fully tested
     - Specifically flag CI/CD workflows and examples as reference implementations
     - Document testing status and plans for full validation

3. Prepare for Phase 5: Testing and Refinement
   - Develop a testing plan for documentation validation
   - Create user journey test scenarios for common documentation paths
   - Define metrics for documentation effectiveness and clarity
   - Prepare templates for gathering user feedback
   - Set up documentation review checklists focused on:
     - Technical accuracy
     - Documentation completeness
     - Consistency of terminology and style
     - Link validation and navigation integrity
   - Establish a documentation refinement process based on feedback

## Key Project Details

### Container Scanning Approaches
- Standard Containers: Using train-k8s-container transport plugin (stable)
- Distroless Containers: Three distinct approaches implemented
  - Debug container approach with chroot (requires ephemeral containers feature)
  - Sidecar container approach with shared process namespace (works universally)
  - Modified transport plugin approach (in progress, most transparent to users)

### CI/CD Integration
- Multiple implementation strategies for each approach
- GitLab CI standard, GitLab CI with services, and GitHub Actions
- Comprehensive examples for all scanning approaches

### Security First Approach
- CINC Auditor (open-source InSpec) to avoid licensing issues
- MITRE SAF-CLI for results processing and threshold validation
- Supporting both label-based and name-based RBAC approaches
- Using short-lived tokens (default 15 minutes) for security
- Least privilege principle applied throughout all implementations
